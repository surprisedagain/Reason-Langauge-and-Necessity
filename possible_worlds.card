It may be worth dwelling upon just how nicely the analytic account of meaning
works out given sets fo possible worlds as meanings.

possible worlds. In a sense 

True by virtue of meaning becomes true by virtue of the mapping from sentences
to possible worlds. i.e., of course, the mapping of that sentenfce alone
guarantees the truth
