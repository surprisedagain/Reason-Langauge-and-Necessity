when combined with something along the lines of the following "plausible" claim:
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.11.1) If it is rational for a person to accept a certain proposition, it
cannot also be rational for that person (at the same time, in the same
circumstances) to accept its denial.
</blockquote>

<p>
which inwagen ultimately fleshes out into the claim that:
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.12.1) Consider any person as he is at a certain moment. That person has
available to him, at that time, a body of evidence, his total evidence at
that moment. Call it E. Of metaphysical necessity, E has the following
property (of itself, regardless of who may have it) with respect to any
proposition p: either (i) it would be rational for anyone to accept p on the
basis of E, or (ii) it would be rational for anyone to accept the denial of
p on the basis of E, or (iii) it would be not be rational for anyone to
accept either p or the denial of p on the basis of E. This 'or' is
exclusive. It cannot be that it would be rational to accept p on the basis
of E and rational to accept the denial of p on the basis of E. Loosely
speaking, a body of evidence cannot have the power to confer rationality on
both a proposition and its denial. And, finally, it is rational for one to
accept a proposition at a certain moment if and only if one's total evidence
at that moment bears this impersonal "confers rationality upon" relation to
that proposition.
</blockquote>

<p>
This seems to force one of the following four "extraordinarily unappealing
options" (where Ism is a controvertial philosophical doctrine one believes):
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.14.1)<br>
1: It is not after all rational for me to accept Ism.<br>
2: It is not rational for any trained philosopher to accept Nism((a theory incompatible with Ism)).<br>
3: Some trained philosophers who accept Nism are in epistemic circumstances
that are inferior to mine in the matter of deciding what to believe about
Ism and Nism.<br>
4: Some of the philosophers who accept Nism are less intelligent than me (or
labor under some other relevant cognitive disadvantage; lack of
philosophical talent, perhaps).<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Inwagen is very unhappy about all these options.
</p>

<p>
As a penultimate solution he claims/conceeds/wails that
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.15.1) therefore, the epistemological principles I have laid out, the
principles that allowed us to deduce strong exclusivism from weak
exclusivism, must be wrong.
</blockquote>

<p>
(Thus he comes dangerously close to considering
<a href="sum(P(t_given_e)_for_all_t)_must_be_over1_for_some_e.html">sum(P(t_given_e)_for_all_t)_must_be_over1_for_some_e</a>, but has already
rejected it as ridiculous.)
</p>

<p>
As a final solution he considers access to private inchoate solutions
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.17.1) . . . some sort of interior, incommunicable evidence
</blockquote>

<p>
But in the end inwagen does not present a solution but rather as make the
problem acute. (A brave and admirable admission of puzzlement.) And he is indeed
correct that there is a problem, but its not quite as bad or as insoluble as he
supposes.

<p>
the paper suffers from the <a href="problem_of_treating_belief_as_binary.html">problem_of_treating_belief_as_binary</a> i.e. the
focus throughout is on "rational to accept p" and never on "rational to accept
p with degree of credence C"
</p>

<p>
This is manifest in the first section where inwagen argues: that since Ism is
<a href="were_right_theyre_wrong.html#weak exclusivism">weakly exclusive</a> then believers in Ism must (on pain of
logical inconsistency no less ) hold that "The teachings of other religions are
at least partly wrong."
</p>

<p>
But consider the following case. Suppose Aden is a "rational" believer in Ism.
who has good reason to believe Ism with a high degree of confidence, but while
high this justified confidence falls short of absolute certainty. It seems Aden
may well recognise this fact, and hence be willing to assert that other
religions are very likely to be wrong, but still unwilling to assert that the
are simply wrong <em>tout court</em>. In hindsight for instance (having since had a
revelation of the truth of some competeing religion) Aden might realise that
while the evidence available to him in the past had strongly supported Ism, and
hence he had been rational to accept Ism's truth, in fact Nism had been true all
along! But a reasonably undogmatic believer in Ism may accept that may be in
such a position even at the time. That while their current belief in Ism is
rational it may turn out that Nism is true.
</p>

<p>
Hence it is <span id="my solution-A preliminary minor flaw-not"></span><strong id="not">not</strong> true that rationally acceptable (aka justified) belief
believe 
</p>

<p>
I don't think this particularly matters the conversation can be reinterpreted
<em>mutatis mutandis</em> in terms of degrees of confidence and degrees of
justification. But I think
</p>


<p>
It is true that it must be rational to believe that other religions are partly
wrong, but it may be the case that it rational to beleive something false. Hence
even though we are rational in believing Ism it may turn out that some other
religion is in fact true.

notice how much the atomistic/rationalistic assumptions underpin this problem
</p>

<p>
For each belief, it is either rational or not to accept it (given the evidence
available to me and perhaps if we are genuine . Insofar as I
accept that belief then I am irrational,

<a href="sum(P(TgivenE)_for_all_t)_must_be_over1_for_some_e.html">sum(P(TgivenE)_for_all_t)_must_be_over1_for_some_e</a>
</p>

<p>
However, a genuine problem remains. Even given this philosophers are certainly
overconfident
All these dogmatic philosophers, each filled by
confidence in their own particular obsession, all wildly disagreeing with each
other. Surely it gives one pause.
