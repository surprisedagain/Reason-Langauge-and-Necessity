By plato, written perhaps ~399 BCE

<p>
The Platonic dialog featuring Meno in which Socrates demonstrates Geometrical
reasoning.
</p>

<div id="main"><h1 id="main" class="header"><a href="#main">main</a></h1></div>
<p>
This is the oldest exemplar of deductive reasoning in the western
tradition<span class='tooltip'>*<span class='tooltiptext'>While the claims involved were certainly known in other cultures (see
<a href="../zz.texts/ancientChineseMathematics.pdf">local:zz.texts/ancientChineseMathematics.pdf</a>) I am unaware of any other
tradition in which general deductive arguments were presented to justify such
claims, or considered as objects of investigation or interest in their own
right</span></span>.  In it Socrates teaches a hitherto ignorant slave boy how to construct
a square that is double the size of a given square.
</p>

<p>
At first the boy mistakenly believes that the method to double the size of
a square is to double the length of each of the sides.<br>
i.e. that the solid blue square below is double the area of the red one.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Socrates, however, convinces the boy that this new square will in fact be four
times as large as the original. Then Socrates shows him that the correct method
is to draw the square based on the diagonal of the original.<br>
i.e. that the true double of the red square is in fact the dashed blue square
below

<p>
One of the lovely features of Plato's dialogues is how many levels they work on
simultaeneously. As is well known, each of the characters Socrates interrogates is a
manifestation of the sort of personality that is attracted to the doctrines they
espouse. hence there is a sense both that these issues touch upon each
individuals whole approach to life and not merely their intellectual beliefs in
isolation.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the Meno, this layering applies to the geometrical argument as
well. The tyro geometrician can appreciate the strength of Socrates argument
and count themselves knowledgeable for being able to understand Socrates prrof
that the square on the diagonal is double the size of the original (see the second image
above as above)
</p>

<p>
But there is a deeper mystery concealed within Socrates example. At one point
Socrates asks the boy of the length of the sides of this doubled square
</p>
<blockquote>
Soc: Then the line which forms the side of eight feet ought to be more than this
</blockquote>
<p>
line of two feet, and less than the other of four feet?
</p>
<blockquote>
Boy: It ought.
Soc: Try and see if you can tell me how much it will be.
</blockquote>

<p>
If we set the length of each side of the original square to 1, then the length
of each side of the dashed blue square (the true double in area) is the square
root of two.
