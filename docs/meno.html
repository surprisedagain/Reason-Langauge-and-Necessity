By plato, written perhaps ~399 BCE
</p>

<p>
The Platonic dialog featuring Meno in which Socrates demonstrates Geometrical
reasoning.

<div id="main"><h1 id="main" class="header"><a href="#main">main</a></h1></div>
<p>
This is the oldest exemplar of deductive reasoning in the western tradition<span class='tooltip'>*<span class='tooltiptext'>and while the claims involved were certainly known to other cultures, I am unaware of any other tradition in which the arguments used to justify were guaranteed to preserve truth, or considered as objects of investigation or interest in their won right</span></span>.
In it Socrates teaches a hitherto ignorant slave boy how to construct a square
that is double the size of a given square.
</p>

<p>
At first the boy mistakenly believes that the method to double the size of
a square is to double the length of each of the sides.<br>
i.e. that the solid blue square below is double the area of the red one.<br>

</p>

<p>
Socrates, however, convinces the boy that this new square will in fact be four
times as large as the original. Then Socrates shows him that the correct method
is to draw the square based on the diagonal of the original.<br>
i.e. that the true double of the red square is in fact the dashed blue square
below<br>
