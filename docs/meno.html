By plato, written perhaps ~399 BCE.
</p>

<p>
The Platonic dialog featuring Meno in which Socrates demonstrates geometrical
reasoning.  Often held to be one of the <q>middle dialogues</q> in which Plato
began to advance his own positive views. In this case a positive (if wildly
implausible) account of the nature of reasoning.
</p>

<div id="main"><h1 id="main" class="header"><a href="#main">main</a></h1></div>
<p>
The Meno contains the oldest exemplar of deductive reasoning in the western
tradition<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">While the geometrical claims involved were certainly known in other
cultures (see <a href="../zz.texts/ancientChineseMathematics.pdf">ancientChineseMathematics</a>) I am unaware of
any other tradition in which general deductive arguments were presented to
justify such claims, or considered as objects of investigation or interest in
their own right</span></span>.  In it Socrates teaches a hitherto ignorant slave boy how to
construct a square that is double the size of a given square.
</p>

<p>
At first the boy mistakenly believes that the method to double the size of
a square is to double the length of each of the sides.<br>
i.e. that the solid blue square below is double the area of the red one.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Socrates, however, convinces the boy that this new square will in fact be four
times as large as the original. Then Socrates shows him that the correct method
is to draw the square based on the diagonal of the original.<br>
i.e. that the true double of the red square is in fact the dashed blue square
below
</p>

</p>

<p>
??the point is that the boy does not gain additional information, neither does
he observe some new feature nor is he told by socrates what is the case, but
rather when the matter is clearly put before him, or perhaps broken up into
simple enough steps (though this is a dangerously misleading analogy) he is able
to discern the truth himself without further intruction. As Socrtates puts
it: <q>Attend now to the questions which I ask him, and observe whether he
learns of me or only remembers.</q>
</p>
<blockquote>
(<a class="heavy" href="../zz.texts/gulley1962-platosTheoryofKnowledge">gulley1962</a>, p.10.1)
Yet it does nothing to invalidate Plato's main point, which is that a
previously untutored slave is able to recognise as indubitably true (or
false) propositions brought to his notice for the first time.

The meno is where Plato first introduces the <a href="plato.html#theory of recollection">theory of recollection</a>.

<div id="main-paradox of enquiry"><h2 id="paradox of enquiry" class="header"><a href="#main-paradox of enquiry">paradox of enquiry</a></h2></div>
<p>
The interaction with the slaveboy is prompted by (the character) 
Meno (the character) also puts forwrd the paradox of analysis:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Meno</b>: And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not
know? What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you find
what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did
not know?<br>
<br>
<b>Socrates</b>: I know, Meno, what you mean; but just see what a tiresome
dispute you are introducing. You argue that man cannot enquire either about
that which he knows, or about that which he does not know; for if he knows,
he has no need to enquire; and if not, he cannot; for he does not know the,
very subject about which he is to enquire.<br>
<br>
<b>Meno</b>: Well, Socrates, and is not the argument sound?
</blockquote>

<div id="main-a further mystery of irrational numbers"><h2 id="a further mystery of irrational numbers" class="header"><a href="#main-a further mystery of irrational numbers">a further mystery of irrational numbers</a></h2></div>
<p>
One of the lovely features of Plato's dialogues is how many levels they work on
simultaeneously. As is well known, each of the characters Socrates interrogates is a
manifestation of the sort of personality that is attracted to the doctrines they
espouse. hence there is a sense both that these issues touch upon each
individuals whole approach to life and not merely their intellectual beliefs in
isolation.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the Meno, this layering applies to the geometrical argument as
well. The tyro geometrician can appreciate the strength of Socrates argument
and count themselves knowledgeable for being able to understand Socrates prrof
that the square on the diagonal is double the size of the original (see the second image
above as above)
</p>

<p>
But there is a deeper mystery concealed within Socrates example. At one point
Socrates asks the boy of the length of the sides of this doubled square
</p>
<blockquote>
Soc: Then the line which forms the side of eight feet ought to be more than this
</blockquote>
<p>
line of two feet, and less than the other of four feet?
</p>
<blockquote>
Boy: It ought.
Soc: Try and see if you can tell me how much it will be.
</blockquote>

<p>
If we set the length of each side of the original square to 1, then the length
of each side of the dashed blue square (the true double in area) is the square
root of two.
