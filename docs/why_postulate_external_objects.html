<p>
let me try this run-up: Rhetorical question 1) Why do we need to posit external
objects at all - (physical) chairs, tables, electrons, notebooks and messenger
bags?
</p>

<p>
Answer: because of the complexity (in quite a well defined computational sense)
of our observations. It is not that we could not "explain" our observations
without such posits, but that we could not even describe the patterns of
observations that we are expect (i.e. that are compatible with our current
theory of the world) without postulating objects.
</p>

<p>
This is connected with Quine's "to be is to be the value of a variable" and his
mild obsession with quantification.  Propositional calculus (i.e. truth
functional logic) is at the lower order of complexity that logicians describe as
having a "decision procedure". Computer scientists describe such collections as
being "recursively decidable". Quantificational calculus (in which <em>objects</em> are
posited) is at the level logicians describe as having a "proof procedure". [and
computer scientists describe such collections as being "recursively
enumerable".]
</p>

<p>
Frege's breakthrough of quantification raised formal logical systems to the
level of complexity required for mathematics (the level of proof procedures).
WHat is it to postulate an object? To include it among the values of variables
that your quantifiers range over (or for asuch inclusion to be required inorder
to make the sentnces of you theory true.)
</p>

<p>
To put it in terms of my fallback computer analogy - a computer programmer
<span id="main-cannot"></span><strong id="cannot">cannot</strong> describe the patterns of input-output that their program is disposed to
produce <span id="main-without describing the inner machinations of their program"></span><strong id="without describing the inner machinations of their program">without describing the inner machinations of their program</strong> (i.e. the
objects inside the program/machine).
</p>

<p>
This may very likely appear irrelvant to you - that is fine - but do you have
some sense of why I am claiming that the postulation of external objects is
required by the complexity of our expectations of future observation? Agreement
is not required, but I need to establish some minimal level of clarity of this
claim before I can move on.
