A brief quasi-historical account of the grave and fundamental problems to which
solutions are ventured in this treatise.

<p>
Long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us to truth. Our minds
contained concepts, and these concepts were either the very same as the
properties of the objects around us or at least very similar to them. (Perhaps
in something like the way that an object and its impression in a clay tablet are
similar.) Maybe these concepts were imprinted in our minds through our senses,
or maybe they were perfect forms of which physical properties were imperfect
copies. But in either case there was a consonance between our concepts and the
properties of the objects around us.  The sensation felt when touching a flame
was thought to be similar to the heat which causes the flame to burn, the weight
felt when lifting a stone similar to the weight in the stone which caused it to
resist being pushed, and the color seen when looking at a white patch of snow
similar to the whiteness of the snow.  Because of these direct encounters with
object's properties we could intuit the fundamental general principles governing
them. 
</p>

<p>
A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the objects around us
(i.e. discern God's ineffable plan)<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Leibniz is perhaps the last influential exponent of this claim.</span></span>;
but even limited intellects such as ours could determine which combinations of
properties were possible or impossible by examining which combinations of<br>
concepts we could conceive of <q>clearly and distinctly</q> (in
<a class="light" href="descartes.html">Descartes'</a> famous phrase).  Objects that could not be conceived,
such as round squares, or triangles whose internal angles did not sum to two
right angles, were impossible.
</p>

<p>
The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume), was geometry.
Geometry taken, not as we now understand it, as an investigation into various
non-physical mathematical idealisations, but as the ancients understood it, an
investigation into the structure of the physical space through which our bodies
move. Geometry was the exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was
taken to show that reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles
imprinted in us by experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and
observation, could produce substantial knowledge of the structure of the world.
There were, of course, famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the
fallibility of the senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that
our justifications for beliefs about the external world did not reach the
standard set by geometry.  Rather than challenging the classical theory of
knowledge, the ancient skeptics simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.
</p>

<p>
In the European intellectual tradition, philosophers began to note the cracks
heralding the long, unstoppable, collapse of these accounts of reason and
knowledge shortly before AD 1650. It is, of course, impossible to put a precise
date upon when the collapse began or ended.  At first, awareness of the problems
that led to the collapse spread piecemeal, and when they were noted they did not
immediately give rise to despair, but rather to various attempts to repair or
resolve these issues.  The death-knell of the ancient account of reasoning might
reasonably be said to have been struck in 1915 with Einstein's discovery that
physical space was not Euclidean. But some thinkers had abandoned hope in the
old scheme long before this, while others continued to hold faith in it even
after this point (indeed some still do, at least unwittingly - <a href="main_introduction.html#What counts as knowledge? What counts a reasoning?">see below</a>).
</p>

<p>
The key factor that caused this collapse, was the undeniable growth in
scientific knowledge.  This growth posed two distinct and fundamental problems
for the traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories"><h2 id="1st problem: the justification of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories">1st problem: the justification of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
While the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor
known with the same certainty as geometrical principles (e.g. that just one
straight line passes through any two distinct points), it was not preposterous
to cast them as like those of geometry in being necessarily true first
principles known with greater certainty than the observable consequences derived
from them. Both these two sorts of principles could be held to be made true by
the essential natures of the objects and properties they concerned. On this
view, the Aristotelian principle that heat rises, for instance, is not an
empirical generalisation, but an essential aspect of the nature of heat. An
aspect that may be grasped, by a mind capable of contemplating general laws, in
a flash of cognition after repeatedly observing hot objects. The new scientific
laws, however, could not be made to fit into this mold.
</p>

<p>
At every point, the fundamental generalisations forming the core of scientific
theories are unlike necessary first principles grasped with certainty in a flash
of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant properties.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties"><h4 id="not sensible properties" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties">not sensible properties</a></h4></div>
<p>
To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in scientific
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  By contrast, human sensory organs are
not sensitive to properties such as charge, field strength and spin.
</p>

<p>
Even the attributions of those properties that might be thought to be sensible,
such as wavelength and mass, is often at odds with ordinary sensations.  The
mass of an object, for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is
dependent upon gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras
the former remains unchanged even in micro-gravity. Thus even though we sense
something commonly correlated with mass (perhaps the force exerted on our
bodies), we do not sense the mass of objects.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths"><h4 id="not necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths">not necessary truths</a></h4></div>
<p>
The next difference is that scientific generalisations are not true necessarily.
Perhaps the most influential exponent of this fact is
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/">Popper</a>, who proclaimed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiability</a> to be the hallmark of scientific claims. According to Popper, a
general statement is falsifiable if and only if there is a possible <q>basic
statement</q> (i.e. a singular existential claim, such as <q>the needle on the
voltmeter is pointing to 11</q>) whose truth is <q>intersubjectively
testable</q> (i.e.  about which observers can come to agreement despite other
differences in their beliefs) with which that general statement is
incompatible. But of course, necessary truths are compatible with any such
<q>basic statement</q> and hence, by Popper's standard, not scientific.
</p>

<p>
Independently of Popper's standard for scientific enquiry, principles such as
the right hand rule governing the movement of charged particles through
magnetic fields have obvious symmetric alternatives that are equally plausible
<em>a priori</em> and yet mutually exclusive. While other principles, such as "Elements
with eight electrons in their outer shell are inert" are too palpably arbitrary
to be necessary. In the other direction, while we may be confident that
Newtonian mechanics is false, it is implausible that it is impossible (or if so,
it makes knowledge of impossibility inaccessible to even the keenest minds for
indefinite periods of time).
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty"><h4 id="not known with certainty" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty">not known with certainty</a></h4></div>
<p>
While Popper formulated his falsification principle in the mid 20th
century, by 1650 Descartes had already recognised that scientific claims gained
credence via their success in predicting observations.  For several
centuries afterwards, it was only dimly apprehended<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">by everyone apart, perhaps,
from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes">Reverend Bayes</a></span></span> that for an experience to give credence to a
hypothesis, <a class="light" href="if_some_experiences_confirm_others_must_infirm.html">there must be other possible experiences which would confute it</a>
(hence Popper's emphasis on falsification); but it <em>was</em> widely understood that
belief in scientific theories was justified by their success in predicting
observations and that they were <em>not deducible from</em> (descriptions of) those
observations.
</p>

<p>
There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10; and secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
<span id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty-guarantee"></span><strong id="guarantee">guarantee</strong> the truth of the general scientific principles they support. It
is possible for a putative law to be vindicated by any finite number of
observations and yet be false.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences"><h4 id="known less certainly than their consequences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences">known less certainly than their consequences</a></h4></div>
<p>
Another point of difference between scientific laws and Aristotelian first
principles, is that scientific laws are known with less certainty than the
particular cases fulfilling them; wheras geometical and arithemetic laws are
known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they subsume.
</p>

<p>
Most of us, for instance, are more certain that addition is symmetric
(i.e. that for all numbers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> + <em>m</em> = <em>m</em> + <em>n</em>) than that
38974298435982 + 87248912374 = 87248912374 + 38974298435982. A modern view may
ascribe this uncertainty to the difficulty of determining whether the
particular case presented falls under the general rule (i.e.  whether, among
other things, the last number in the equation just given is the same as the
first). Plato, however, relied upon a looser and more complex relationship
between ordinary objects and the forms than instantiation <em>simpliciter</em>; he held 
that ordinary objects <q>fall short</q> of the forms, realising those forms
only imperfectly (see <a href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html#Geometrical figures exist">truths_of_reason_by_chisholm#Geometrical figures exist</a>).
This shortcoming means that ordinary sensible objects may fail to
fulfill the laws obtaining between the forms they imperfectly instantiate. In
either case the general law is more certain that its exemplification in any
given instance.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, scientific generalisations, even mundane ones such as <q>Blue
litmus paper turns red when immersed in acid</q> are known with less certainty
than particular observations of their instances.  Indeed on the modern view it
follows from fundamental principles of probability that such generalizations
must be less certain than observations of any particular positive instance.
For the falsehood of any of instance would render the universal claim false as
well, and hence the probability of the universal claim must be lower than the
probability of that claim being fulfilled in any particular case where it
applies.
</p>

<p>
The final point of difference, which is also the most difficult to make sense of
from the modern viewpoint, is that scientific laws are not grasped in a flash of
insight after repeated sensation. After repeated encounters with circles, one
might in a sudden insight, realise that each is a set of points equidistant from
a centre. After repeated encounters with lines, one may realise that just one
line passes through any pair of distinct points. But one does not, after
repeatedly lifting heavy objects, suddenly realise that the gravitational
constant is 6.6743 +/- 0.00015 x 10<sup><small>-11</small></sup> Newton square meters per square
kilogram.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-Implications of these differences"><h3 id="Implications of these differences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-Implications of these differences">Implications of these differences</a></h3></div>
<p>
The differences just noted make it clear that knowledge of scientific
generalisations is not justified in the way prescribed by the traditional view.
Such is the tenacity and strength of that view on modern minds however, that a
dawning realisation that the traditional account of the justification of
knowledge is not true of our knowledge of scientific theories, often first
manifests itself as scepticism; a denial that we have knowledge of scientific
generalizations at all.
</p>

<p>
So it was for <a class="light" href="descartes.html">Descartes</a>. The motivating problem of the
<a href="cogito.html">cogito</a> (viz., that our theories of the external world could not be deduced
from observations and necessary first principles) became known as <q>Cartesian
scepticism</q> and went on to become the chief motivating problem of modern
philosophy (or, in Kant's famous words, <q>the scandal of philosopy</q>); while
Descartes' attempt to place our knowledge of scientific theories on the same
solid, deductive, foundations as geometry and mathematics was initially derided
as ridiculous, and then largely ignored as second rate.  So it remains for many
philosophy students today, who often leave their encounter with Cartesian
scepticism in first year philosophy, convinced that the take home message of
philosophy is that no-one <em>really</em> knows anything except their own experiences
(to which they have direct access) and perhaps some mathematical theorems (i.e.
claims of which the traditional account of knowledge remains at least
superficially plausible).  Nor is this insistance upon rejecting all claims of
knowledge that are not justified by the lights of the traditional view limited
to novices and innovators. It is the basis of Russell's<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">p.201 Theory of
knowledge, via <em>The basic writings of Bertrand Russell</em>, Routledge classics
2009</span></span> complaint that <q>. . . when people begin to philosophize they seem to
think it necessary to make themselves artificially stupid</q> (i.e. to reject
all knowledge claims apart from those that can de deduced from one's own
observations and perhaps axioms of mathematics which may be viewed as
definitional).
</p>

<p>
Such is not the course taken in this work. Our knowledge of scientific
claims, such as the charge of electrons, the speed of light (and its
invariance), that the force of attraction between massive objects is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them, is far better
supported than the traditional account of the justification of knowledge. If
that traditional account implies that we do not have such knowledge, then it is
the traditional account itself, and not the claims to knowledge that it denies
that must be rejected. What we seek is an account of reasoning and knowledge
that is compatible with our having knowledge (or whatever positive
epistemological state it is held to be, if the term <q>knowledge</q> is reserved
for those beliefs justified in accordance with traditional view) of scientific
generalisations.
</p>

<p>
Our mere possesion of knowledge of scientific generalisations does not, however,
immediately discredit the traditional account altogether. It does show
that account to be incomplete (i.e. that there are some forms of knowledge which
are not justified in the way that view specifies), but it does not show that
<span id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-Implications of these differences-no"></span><strong id="no">no</strong> knowledge is justified in that way. It compatible with both the traditional
account of knowledge, and our possession of knowledge of scientific
generalisations to hold that the traditional view of knowledge is correct within
its own limited sphere, but there is a further knowledge beyond this sphere of
which it is not correct.
</p>

<p>
This compatibilist view is perhaps the dominant one amongst educated laymen and
scientific researchers. It forms a pleasing story of historical progress and
development in which philosphy is related to modern science in something like
the way medieval alchemy is related to modern chemistry.  Philosophy, on
this view, is a pre-cursor of modern science, clogged with superstition and
false claims of insight, and superceded by techniques that are at once less
extravagant, more powerful and self-consciously empirical, and producing
theories that are both less riddled by falsehood and more far reaching.
</p>

<p>
The analogy with alchemy breaks down at a key point however. In modern chemistry
alchemy is completely superceeded, its techniques and principles either
discarded altogether or justified by means entirely within the field of
chemistry. There is no residual core of alchemical principles which modern
chemistry relies upon but cannot justify. By contrast, modern science retains,
according to this story, a reliance upon supposedly ancient philosophy in the
the sphere of deductive inference<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">see <a href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html">truths_of_reason_by_chisholm</a> for a modern exposition of this view</span></span>.
The ancient principles<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Supposedly. One of the more undeniable though less immediately profound falsehoods in this history is that the full range of logical techniques required in mathematical reasoning was only first adequately and rigourously described in 1879 by Frege</span></span>
within the limited sphere of mathematics, geometry and deductive logic
remain indispensible to modern scientific theories. Proponents of
this compatibilist pseudo-history may view the question of the jusrtification of
these principles (and the attendant patterns of inference) as puzzle for
lesser minds; minds who are less

</p>

<p>
Perhaps the question of how knowledge of these truths and the conclusions of
such reasoning are justified is only a puzzle for lesser minds, 
but perhaps only by lesser
minds who are puzzled by truths that the more elevated find obvious and in no
need of further support.

scientific theories and principles. That, of course, does not imply that we do
not have such knowledge but merely that the old account was, at best partial.

of knowledge and justification did not fit scientific laws, 
</p>

<p>
????- CLEAR NOT FIRST PRINCIPLES - DESCARTES
For all these reasons it is abundantly clear that Descartes
was first and foremost among those who noted that and his first response was to
attempt to reconcile. In his Meditations he proposed to <em>deduce</em> the existence
of God from his famous <a href="cogito.html">cogito ergo sum</a>, and thence to deduce that the
the clear and distinct hypotheses that came to human minds to predict and
systematise thewir observations must be true, since God would not deceive us;
thus he proposed to reconcile 
</p>

<p>
Descrates was perhaps the first, and certainly the foremost, of those 
who recognised that scientific generalisations were not deductive consequences
of the observations that gave them credence. His response was not to proppose any
modification of the traditional accounts but rather to explain away the
indeducibility of scientific theories from certain first principles as a mere
appearance. 
</p>

<p>
His '<a class="light" href="cogito_ergo_sum.html">cogito_ergo_sum</a>', was supposed to be a first
principle form which, with God's grace, all science could be derived.
For if the existence of a beneficent God could be proven, then 
</p>

<p>
God would not be so deceitful as to place in our minds principles which
perfectly predicted our observations but were yet false. In this way he hoped to
show that scientific laws were deducible from first principles (most importantly

side. and that the methods of philosophy were simply superseded by those of

<p>
But its that the revolution did not go deep enough.
</p>

<p>
Belief in the scientific method, is itself a kind of a projection of the old
scheme onto new materials. The hope that there might be some principles of
so-called abductive or inductive reasoning, rules for deriving general formulas
from finite observations; rules as clearly and definitely describable as the
princples of classical deductive logic but justifying less than absolute
certainrty in their conclusions.

GOOD
The second problem concerned the content of the new knowledge.
The developing scientific theories concerning the
processes giving rise to experience, directly contradicted the traditional
claims upon which the old accounts of reason and knowledge relied. The new
understanding of the physical, chemical and physiological process underlying
perception, made it clear that what was going on at the surface of well lit
objects was wildly different to the streams of particles or waves that traveled
from those surfaces to our eyes, which was wildly different to the
electro-chemical reactions in our retina, which was wildly different again to
the electrical signals that traveled from those retina to our brains. Hume went
so far as to consider the mental processes of thinking and sensing themselves to
be mechanical processes and hence subject to faults like all other mechanisms;
but even if the eventual sensations that these processes led up to were in
non-physical minds, the illusion that our minds had anything remotely
describable as direct contact with the properties of the objects around us was
irretrievably shattered. For a while, it was thought that the old account might
yet be true of knowledge of one's own psychological states, and hope remained
that mental objects might be known with the same certainty and directness that
had been attributed to our knowledge of the properties (if not the objects)
presented in our sensations of the external world. One effect of this was a
lingering sense that philosophy was more closely connected to psychology than to
other sciences. But even this remaining illusion largely collapsed in the face
of Freud's theories which (even if they were wildly wrong) made it plausible
that our knowledge of many of our own mental states was fallible; and
Wittgenstein's suggestions that ascriptions of mental states were justified not
by private experiences but rather by public behaviour.

<p>
Someone who has survived a modern day university arts course, or engaged with
almost any of the academic humanities as they are currently practised, may
naturally suspect that any enquiry into the nature of knowledege and reasoning
must begin by defining its terms, and that those definitions will largely
pre-determine what account we eventually arrive at regarding the nature of
reasoning and knowledge.  That, to put in its crudest form, "It all depends on
what you mean by 'knoweldge' and 'reasoning'".  This view however, is itself a
remnant of the ancient view outlined above, according to which the only way to
arrive at knowledge is by starting with certain principles (reflecting either
the essential properties of objects or our definitions or perhaps both) and then
derive consequences from them. The fact that such approaches are still often
regarded as the pre-eminent method of conducting an intellectual investigation
is both a sign of how the ancient view lingers on in the humanities departments
of academia, and how bankrupt those departments have (often) become.
</p>

<p>
The approach followed here is more akin to an investigation into a new and
only partly understaood observed phenomena.  Rather than starting with
definitions we shall begin with exemplars and search for any underlying
principles that might explain or unite them.

Like the ancients Geometry, the giving of proofs concerning the relative length
of lines, closed figures consisting of such lines and the size of circles and
angles. The proof by which each of us is genuinely convinced that the area of
the square based upon the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the
sum of the reas of the squares based on its other two sides(and not merely brow
beaten into acquiesing with this claim). The argument Socrates presents to the
slave boy in the <a href="Meno.html">Meno</a> oldest exemplar of this kind of
reasoning (in any tradition <span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">While mathematicians in both China and the Indus
valley knew of geometrical truths including Pythagoras's theorem hundreds of
years before the Greeks, in those traditions they were justified by
examples. Iboth chinese mathematicians and those of the
These must all count as reasoning, and
the claims issued must in some sense count as true.
</p>


<p>
Whatever is going in these exemplars had better count as
reasoning.
</p>

<p>
The attitude I am proposing to follow can be couched as a form of
humility. If our philosophical account of reasoning implies that any of the
cases above are not instances of reasoning, or that they do not lead us to
gain justified true beliefs about the world or that those beliefs are not
knwoledge; then it is more likely that our account of knowlege and reasoning is
wrong rather than those cases not being knowledge. Rather than collapsing into
scepticism if the account of reasoning we uncover does not fit our
preconceptions, let us take our amazing success in producing knowledge in
geometry, mathematics, science and everyday life as more certain than any
philosopher's crazy theory.

<p>
The sense that there is a deep connection between can alreqady be sensed in the
oldest account of reasoning
</p>

<p>
How is it that our beliefs (i.e. the
things/states/whatever that reason is capable of justifying belief in) are
about the world at all? It seems that when we are justified in believing
we are justified in beliving it to be true, and it is true
