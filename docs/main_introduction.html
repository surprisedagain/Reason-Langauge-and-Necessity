A historical introduction to the grave and fundamental problems for which
solutions are ventured in this treatise.

<p>
Long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us to truth. Our minds
contained concepts, and these concepts were either the very same as the
properties of the objects around us or at least very similar to them. (Perhaps
in something like the way that an object and its impression in a clay tablet are
similar.) Maybe these concepts were imprinted in our minds through our senses,
or maybe they were perfect forms of which physical properties were imperfect
copies. But in either case there was a consonance between our concepts and the
properties of the objects around us.  The sensation felt when touching a flame
was thought to be similar to the heat which causes the flame to burn, the weight
felt when lifting a stone similar to the weight in the stone which caused it to
resist being pushed, and the color seen when looking at a white patch of snow
similar to the whiteness of the snow.  Because of these direct encounters with
objects' properties we could intuit the fundamental general principles governing
them. 
</p>

<p>
A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the material world around us (i.e. discern God's
ineffable plan)<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Leibniz is perhaps the last influential exponent of this claim.</span></span>; but even limited intellects such as ours could determine
which combinations of properties were possible or impossible by examining which
combinations of concepts we could conceive of <q>clearly and distinctly</q> (in
Descartes' famous phrase).  Objects that could not be conceived, such as round
squares, or triangles whose internal angles did not sum to two right angles,
were impossible.
</p>

<p>
The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume), was geometry.
Geometry taken, not as we now understand it, as an investigation into various
non-physical mathematical idealisations, but as the ancients understood it, an
investigation into the spatial properties of physical objects. Geometry was the
exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was taken to show that
reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles imprinted in us by
experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and observation, could produce
substantial knowledge of the structure of the world.  There were, of course,
famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the fallibility of the
senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that our justifications
for beliefs about the external world did not reach the standard set by geometry.
Rather than challenging the classical theory of knowledge, the ancient skeptics
simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.
</p>

<p>
In the European intellectual tradition, philosophers began to note the cracks
heralding the long, unstoppable, collapse of their account of reason and
knowledge shortly before AD 1650. It is, of course, impossible to put a precise
date upon when the collapse began or ended.  At first, awareness of the problems
in the traditional accounts spread piecemeal, and when they were noted they did
not immediately give rise to despair, but rather to various attempts to repair
or resolve them.  The death-knell of the ancient account of reasoning might
reasonably be said to have been struck in 1919, when decisive empirical evidence
was gathered confirming Einstein's theory that physical space was not Euclidean.
But some thinkers had abandoned hope in the old scheme long before this, while
others continued to hold faith in it even after this point (see <a href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html">Chisholm, 1987</a>)
and even in those who officially abandoned it, its influence continues to run
deep (see <a href="main_introduction.html#What counts as knowledge? What counts a reasoning?">below</a>).
</p>

<p>
The key factor that caused this collapse, was the undeniable growth in
scientific knowledge. This growth posed two distinct and fundamental problems
for the traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories"><h2 id="1st problem: the justification of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories">1st problem: the justification of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
While the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor
known with the same certainty as geometrical principles, it was not preposterous
to cast them as being like geometrical principles in being necessarily true
and known with greater certainty than the observable consequences derived
from them. Both geometrical and physical principles could be held to be made
true by the essential natures of the objects and properties they concerned. On
this view, the Aristotelian principle that heat rises, for instance, is not an
empirical generalisation, but an essential aspect of the nature of heat. An
aspect that may be grasped, by a mind capable of contemplating general laws, in
a flash of cognition after repeatedly observing hot objects. The new scientific
laws, however, could not be made to fit into this mold.
</p>

<p>
At every point, the fundamental generalisations forming the core of scientific
theories are unlike necessary first principles grasped with certainty in a flash
of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant properties.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties"><h4 id="not sensible properties" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties">not sensible properties</a></h4></div>
<p>
To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in scientific
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  By contrast, human sensory organs are
not sensitive to properties such as charge, field strength and spin.
</p>

<p>
Even the attributions of those properties that might be thought to be sensible,
such as wavelength and mass, is often at odds with ordinary sensations.  The
mass of an object, for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is
dependent upon gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras
the former remains unchanged even in micro-gravity. Thus even though we sense
something commonly correlated with mass (perhaps the force exerted on our
bodies), we do not sense the mass of objects.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths"><h4 id="not necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths">not necessary truths</a></h4></div>
<p>
The next difference is that scientific generalisations are not true necessarily.
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/">Popper</a> is perhaps the most influential exponent of this claim. He proclaimed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiability</a> to be the hallmark of scientific claims.
According to Popper, a general statement is falsifiable if and only if there is
a possible <q>basic statement</q> (i.e. a singular existential claim, such as
<q>the needle on the voltmeter is pointing to 11</q>) whose truth is
<q>intersubjectively testable</q> (i.e.  about which observers can come to
agreement despite other differences in their beliefs) with which that general
statement is incompatible. But of course, necessary truths are compatible with
every <q>basic statement</q> and hence, by Popper's standard, not scientific<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">and, <em>tollens</em> to <em>ponens</em>, no scientific truth is necessary</span></span>.
</p>

<p>
Independently of Popper's standard for scientific enquiry, principles such as
the right hand rule governing the movement of charged particles through
magnetic fields have obvious symmetric alternatives that are equally plausible
<em>a priori</em> and yet mutually exclusive. While other principles, such as
<q>Elements with eight electrons in their outer shell are inert</q> are too palpably
arbitrary to be necessary.
</p>

<p>
In the other direction, while we may be confident that Newtonian mechanics is
false, it is implausible that it is impossible (or if so, it makes knowledge of
impossibility inaccessible to even the keenest minds for indefinite periods of
time).
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty"><h4 id="not known with certainty" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty">not known with certainty</a></h4></div>
<p>
While Popper formulated his falsification principle in the mid 20th
century, by 1650 <a href="Descartes.html">Descartes</a> had already recognised that scientific claims gained
credence via their success in predicting observations.  For several
centuries afterwards, it was only dimly apprehended<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">by everyone apart, perhaps, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes">Reverend Bayes</a></span></span>
that for an experience to give credence to a hypothesis,
<a href="if_some_experiences_confirm_others_must_infirm.html">there must be other possible experiences which would confute it</a>
(hence Popper's emphasis on falsification); but it <em>was</em> widely understood that
belief in scientific theories was justified by their success in predicting
observations and that they were <em>not deducible from</em> (descriptions of) those
observations.
</p>

<p>
There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10; and secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
<em>guarantee</em> the truth of the general scientific principles they support. It
is possible for a supposedly universal law to be vindicated by any finite number
of observations and yet be false.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences"><h4 id="known less certainly than their consequences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences">known less certainly than their consequences</a></h4></div>
<p>
Another point of difference between scientific laws and Aristotelian first
principles, is that scientific laws are known with less certainty than the
particular cases fulfilling them; wheras geometical and arithemetic laws are
known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they subsume.
</p>

<p>
Most of us, for instance, are more certain that addition is symmetric
(i.e. that for any pair of numbers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> + <em>m</em> = <em>m</em> + <em>n</em>) than that
38974298435982 + 87248912374 = 87248912374 + 38974298435982. A modern view may
ascribe this uncertainty to the difficulty of determining whether the particular
case presented falls under the general rule (i.e.  whether, among other things,
the sixth digit of last number in the equation just given is the same as the
sixth digit in the first first). Plato, by contrast, relied upon a looser and
more complex relationship between ordinary objects and the forms than
instantiation <em>simpliciter</em>; he held that ordinary objects realise forms only
imperfectly<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">see <a class="heavy" href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html#Geometrical figures exist">Chisholm's discussion of geometrical figures</a> for a modern exponent of the view</span></span>.  This shortcoming means that ordinary sensible objects may fail
to fulfill the laws obtaining between the forms they imperfectly instantiate. In
either case the general law is more certain that its exemplification in any
given instance.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, scientific generalisations, even mundane ones such as <q>Blue
litmus paper turns red when immersed in acid</q> are known with less certainty
than particular observations of their instances.  Indeed on the modern view it
follows from fundamental principles of probability that such generalizations
must be less certain than observations of any particular positive instance.
For the falsehood of any of instance would render the universal claim false as
well, and hence the probability of the universal claim must be lower than the
probability of that claim being fulfilled in any particular case where it
applies.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not intuitable as a result of observation"><h4 id="not intuitable as a result of observation" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-not intuitable as a result of observation">not intuitable as a result of observation</a></h4></div>
<p>
The final point of difference, which is also the most difficult to make sense of
from the modern viewpoint, is that scientific laws are not grasped in a flash of
insight after repeated sensation. After repeated encounters with circles, one
might in a sudden insight, realise that each is a set of points equidistant from
a centre. After repeated encounters with lines, one may realise that just one
line passes through any pair of distinct points. But one does not, after
repeatedly lifting heavy objects, suddenly realise that the gravitational
constant is 6.6743 +/- 0.00015 x 10<sup><small>-11</small></sup> Newton square meters per square
kilogram.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences"><h3 id="consequences of these differences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-1st problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences">consequences of these differences</a></h3></div>
<p>
The differences just noted make it clear that knowledge of scientific
generalisations is not justified in the way prescribed by the traditional view.
Such is the tenacity and strength of the traditional view's hold on modern minds
however, that a dawning realisation that our knowledge of scientific truths is
not justified in this way, often first manifests itself as scepticism; a denial
that we have knowledge of scientific generalizations at all.
</p>


<p>
So it was for <a href="Descartes.html">Descartes</a>. The starting point of his <a class="heavy" href="descartes.html#cogito">cogito</a> is the
realisation that that our theories of the external world could not be deduced
from observations and necessary first principles, and hence our knowledge of
them was dubious.  This doubt became known as <q>Cartesian scepticism</q> and
went on to become the chief motivating problem of early modern philosophy<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">in Kant's words, <q>the scandal of philosophy</q></span></span>.
is subsequent attempt to place our knowledge of scientific theories on the same
solid, deductive, foundations as geometry and mathematics, however, was derided
as ridiculous by many of his <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dKxa3gAvWR8C">contemporaries</a>, and largely treated as a second
rate addendum by his successors.
</p>

<p>
So it remains for many philosophy students today, who often leave their first
year encounter with Cartesian scepticism convinced that the take home message of
philosophy is that no-one <em>really</em> knows anything except their own experiences
(to which they have direct access) and perhaps some mathematical theorems; i.e.
claims of which the traditional account of knowledge remains at least
superficially plausible.  Nor is this insistence upon rejecting all claims of
knowledge that are not justified by the lights of the traditional view limited
to pioneers and novices. Russell notes the wide spread of this scepticism in his
complaint that <q>. . . when people begin to philosophize they seem to think it
necessary to make themselves artificially stupid</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Theory of knowledge, p.201 via <em>The basic writings of Bertrand Russell</em>, Routledge classics 2009</span></span> (i.e. to
reject all knowledge claims apart from those that can de deduced from their own
observations and first principles known with certainty).
</p>

<p>
Such scepticism is not the starting point of this work. Our knowledge of
scientific claims, such as the charge of electrons, the speed of light in a
vacuum (and its invariance), and that massive objects attract each other with a
force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, is far
better supported than the traditional account of the justification of knowledge.
If that traditional account implies that we do not have such knowledge, then it
is the traditional account itself, and not the claims to knowledge it denies
that must be rejected. What we seek is an account of reasoning and knowledge
that is compatible with our having knowledge<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">or whatever positive epistemological state it is held to be, if the term <q>knowledge</q> is reserved for those beliefs justified in accordance with traditional view</span></span> of both
scientific generalisations <em>and</em> the principles underpinning deductive
inference.
</p>

<p>
Our mere possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations does not
immediately discredit the traditional account altogether. It does show that
account to be incomplete (i.e. that some knowledge is not justified in the way
that view specifies) but it does not show that <em>no</em> knowledge is justified in
that way. It compatible with both the traditional account of knowledge, and our
possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations to hold that the
traditional view of knowledge is correct within some limited sphere, but that
there is also further knowledge beyond this sphere, of which it is not correct.
</p>

<p>
Such a view is perhaps the dominant one amongst educated laymen and
scientific researchers. It forms a pleasing story of historical progress and
development in which philosophy is related to modern science in something like
the way medieval alchemy is related to modern chemistry. Philosophy, on this
view, is a pre-cursor of modern science, clogged with superstition and false
claims of insight; superceded by scientific techniques that are less fanciful,
more precise and self-consciously based upon empirical evidence, and which
produce theories less riddled by falsehood and possessing greater
predictive power.
</p>

<p>
The analogy with alchemy breaks down at a key point however. In modern chemistry
alchemy is completely superceeded, its techniques and principles either
rejected or justified by means entirely within the field of
chemistry. There is no residual core of alchemical principles which modern
chemistry relies upon but cannot justify. By contrast, modern science retains,
according to this story, a reliance upon supposedly ancient philosophy in the
the sphere of deductive inference<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">see <a href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html">truths_of_reason_by_chisholm</a> for a modern exposition of this view</span></span>.  Within a limited sphere that includes
mathematics, geometry and deductive logic, the ancient principles<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Supposedly. One of the more concrete problems with this history is that the full range of logical techniques required in mathematical reasoning was only first adequately and rigourously described in 1879 by Frege</span></span>
remain indispensible to modern scientific theories and yet apparently
unjustifiable by scientific methods.
</p>

<p>
The continued dependence of science upon apparently unscientific deductive
principles has led many philosophers<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Kant is the exemplar, but there is no shortage of others who have followed his lead; both wittingly and unwittingly.</span></span> to claim that the success
of science in producing knowledge can <em>only</em> show that the traditional account
of the justification of knowledge is incomplete, and never that it is altogether
wrong, on the grounds that science cannot altogether undermine the unscientific
source of knowledge discerned by ancient philosophers without undermining
itself.  That philosophers might find this claim appealing is easily understood,
for it neatly defends the continued relevance and value of philosophical
enquiries to actual knowledge production and tacitly establishes philosophy as
the queen of the sciences, standing in judgement over all the rest.  Despite its
appeal, however, this comforting pablum has two serious defects. It relies upon
the dubious assumption that the traditional account is the only<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">or at least the
best, though in practice alternatives are almost never considered</span></span> explanation
of our knowledge of the truths of geometry, mathematics and logic etc., upon
which scientific theories continue to rely; and it ignores the depth of the
conflict between the traditional account and the <em>content</em> of our scientific
theories.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-2nd problem: the content of scientific theories"><h2 id="2nd problem: the content of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-2nd problem: the content of scientific theories">2nd problem: the content of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
The first problem for the traditional account of knowledge was simply that we
<em>possess</em> knowledge that is not justified by the lights of that account. The
second problem is that the <em>content</em> of that knowledge is wildly incompatible 
with the claims upon which the traditional account of reasoning and knowledge
relied.
</p>

<p>
St. Thomas Aquinas was probably the original, and certainly the most influential
author of the phrase <q>Nothing is in the mind that was not first in the
senses</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or rather, of the Latin phrase of which this is the English translation; viz., <q>Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu</q>.</span></span> but, quite fairly, he attributed the spirit of
the precept to Aristotle. It became a commonplace of medieval scholastic
philosophy, discussed by Bonaventure, Matthew of Aquasparta, and Duns Scotus.
The truth of the dictum does not directly concern us here, what does concern us
is that it makes clear the traditional commitment to our concepts being the same
as the properties presented in our sensations.  Even Plato, who held our
knowledge of the forms to be memories from a previous life in a divine realm
where we had contemplated those forms directly, also held that the poor sensible
copies presented by our senses in this world were yet close enough to spark our
remembrance of their perfect originals. Of course, philosophers being what they
are, these views are riven by further dispute. St Thomas claimed that the
<q>active intellect</q> which enabled us to grasp the universal properties
exemplified in our sensations, was an aspect of individual human intellects;
wheras his predecessors Ibn Sina held there to be just one active intellect
common to all humans, and St. Augustine considered this one common element to be
God's divine illumination. Grouping all these views under the title of <q>the
traditional account</q> is not intended to deny the profound differences between
and amongst Platonists and Aristotelians, but simply to emphasise that the
belief that that our concepts are at least <em>similar</em> to the properties of our
sensations, was an orthodoxy amongst European and Arabic philosophers from
Aristotle up until Descartes.
</p>

<p>
According to the traditional account, not only were the properties of our
sensations the same as the concepts in our minds, they were also the properties
of the physical objects around us. As Aristotle put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
A sense is that which has the power of receiving perceptible forms without
the matter, in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the imprint of the
signet ring without the iron or gold; it takes the imprint of a signet of
bronze or gold, but not qua bronze or gold. In a similar way the sense is
affected by what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, not insofar as each
is what it is, but insofar as it is of such a sort and according to its
logos.(<em>De Anima</em> II.12)
</blockquote>
<p>
The colour of the distant red object is, through the light created
transparency of the intervening air, able to impress itself on the parts of
the eye that were sensitive to it. The property present in the sensitive parts
of the eye (and by which those parts are affected) is the very same as the
property of the distant object.
</p>

<p>
This triple identity, between the concepts by which we think of objects, the
forms realised without matter in our sensations, and the forms realised by the
material objects that we perceive and think of, was supposed to ensure that our
concepts <em>are</em> the properties of the objects around us.  In Aquinas' words:
<q>The intellect, by the act of understanding, is made one with the object
understood</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><em>Nam intellectus, secundum hoc quod actu intelligit, secundum hoc fit unum cum intellecto</em></span></span>; or as Gaetanus, a later influential commentator on Aquinas put it
<q>to know is nothing else than for the intellect to be [the thing known] and
the species is the form whereby it comes to that being.</q> We moderns may
wonder at this somewhat mystical unity between acts of cognition and the objects
cognised<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Aquinas held it to be the same unity as obtains between Jesus, the word of God, and God the father, who is the source of that word.</span></span>, and scholars continue to dispute various interpretations of
Aristotle's account of the relationships between substances, species, forms and
universals; but what is clear, in modern terms, is that the properties possessed
by the objects around us, the properties presented in our immaterial sensations
and the concepts by which we think of those objects were held to be the same.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was because the properties we were manipulating in our imaginations,
memories and intellects were the very same as the properties instantiated by the
material objects around us, that the manipulations we could or could not perform
in thought reflected the combinations of properties that could or could not be
realised in objects outside our minds. Our minds were in direct contact with the
properties of the external world and hence reason, the capacity to abstract
those universal properties from particular instances, could give us insight
into the necessary relationships between those properties.
</p>

<p>
All of these claims were directly, unequivocally and irrefutably discredited by
scientific discoveries.
</p>

<p>
The history of the collapse of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning is complicated by the fact that the traditional Aristotelian theories
of sensation and knowledge were not directly replaced by scientific theories
based upon experiment and observation, but were instead swept away by a wave of
wild armchair speculation with only a tenuous connection to empirical evidence.
</p>

<p>
At the start of the 17th century Galileo set off a wave of speculative physics
that spread over Europe. Galileo certainly believed some speculative
theories himself, but his most significant discoveries were closely based on
observation and experiment.  His treatise <em>The Starry Messenger</em> (1610)
contained the first report of observations of heavenly bodies made through a
telescope; and his
<em>Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences</em><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche intorno a due nuove scienze.  The two new sciences being static engineering [the strength of unmoving structures] and motion.</span></span> (1638)
contained a quantitative description of the distance travelled by
<q>naturally</q> falling bodies<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">i.e. bodies falling solely under the influence of gravity</span></span>, namely that <q>the spaces traversed were to each
other as the squares of the times</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">e.g. a body will fall four times as far
in two seconds as it does in one</span></span>, and described measurements he had made of a
bronze ball rolling down an inclined plane that confirmed the claim. His private
notebooks also reveal a wealth of experiments, though these were downplayed in
his published work, where he tended to present his claims as deducible from
first principles.
</p>

<p>
Like Galileo's description of acceleration due to gravity, the laws Newton laid
out 80 years later in his <em>Mathematical principles of Natural Philosophy</em> (1687)
were also quantitative and explicitly based upon experimental data.  It is
notable, however, that Newton vigourously rejected the description of his work
as <q>experimental philosophy</q> and insisted, somewhat inconstantly, that his
laws of motion were not hypotheses which he had tested against empirical
evidence, but rather regularities of nature which could simply be read off from
the empirical data he had assembled. This rejection may be more easily
understood once the range of hypotheses ventured by his contemporaries and
immediate predecessors is recognised.
</p>

<p>
In between these breakthroughs, what is striking is how little any of the
multitude of mechanistic physical theories proposed by European natural
philosophers were supported by observation or experiment. Descartes
proposed mechanistic theories concerning magnetism, the pumping of blood, the
movement of cosmological bodies, the nature of heat and the mechanism of sight,
but the only point at which he overtly based his theories upon his own
experimental observations concerned the splitting of sunlight into a spectrum by
refraction through a prism or glass ball filled with water.  Gassendi, the most
influential of the modern atomists before Boyle, ventured explanations of some
physical phenomena (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog">sundogs</a> which had been widely observed in Rome
in 1629) and noted the new visions revealed through microscopes, but he
justified his belief in discrete atoms more by references to Lucretius and the
avoidance of Zeno's paradox than any empirical observation (see
<a class="heavy" href="timeline_of_corpuscularian_theories_of_sensation.html">timeline_of_corpuscularian_theories_of_sensation</a>).
</p>

<p>
Galileo's published works inspired generations of natural philosophers to reject
any but mechanistic theories. Theories in which physical phenomena were
explained purely in terms of the size, shape and motion of bodies acting on each
other only through direct contact.  In Hobbes words:
</p>
<blockquote>
as for those that say any thing may be moved or produced by it Self, by
Species, by its own Power, by Substantial Forms, by Incorporeal Substances,
by Instinct, by Anteperistasis, by Antipathy, Sympathy, Occult Quality, and
other empty words of Schoolmen, their saying so is to no purpose.<br>
(1656 <em>Elements of Philosophy</em>)
</blockquote>
<p>
But Galileo's influence did not cure those natural philosophers of their
speculative tendencies, nor of their general preference for armchair theorizing
over menial laboratory experiments.  Indeed, as good constraints often do, the
constraints on mechanistic theories caused creative speculation to flourish.
</p>

<p>
The bodily mechanisms involved in movement and sensation were a particularly
attractive topic of speculation. Galileo had realised from the outset that if
mechanistic theories were to be plausible they would have to explain our
sensations of colour, taste and scent as arising from mechanical interactions
between the external bodies and our sensory organs.  Indeed this was the main
focus of his 1623 work <em>the Assayer</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to inhere, these
tastes, odors, colors, etc., are nothing but empty names; rather they inhere
only in the sensitive body, such that if one removes the animal, then all
these qualities are taken away and annihilated.
</blockquote>
<p>
Even if the eventual sensations that these processes led up to were, as
Descartes held, non-physical, an account of the external bodies that travelled
from distant objects to our sensory organs was required, together with an
account of how those bodies interacted with the sensory organs and of the
mechanisms by which signals were conveyed from those organs to the brain or
heart or wherever else the locus of interactions between body and mind was held
to be.
</p>

<p>
Hobbes explicitly exemplified both these tendencies, holding both that the
principles of mechanical physics could be demonstratively deduced from the
definitions of the terms <q>body</q>, <q>motion</q> and <q>cause</q> and hence
did not need to be established by experiment and observation; and also that
<q>The cause of Sense is the Externall Body, or Object, which presseth the organ
proper to each Sense, .  . . which pressure, by the mediation of the Nerves, and
other strings, and membranes of the body, continued inwards to the Brain and
Heart</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><em>Leviathan</em></span></span>.
</p>

<p>
As history turned out, it was muscular movements, rather than sensory signals,
that received the lion's share of attention and were the subject of the first
breakthroughs. Here, as with gravity, it was compressive or attractive forces
that proved most difficult to explain in terms of mechanistic interactions.
Indeed, the lack of any plausible mechanism for muscular contractions had led
Descartes to reject Harvey's claim that the blood was pumped by contractions of
the heart, though he accepted the rest of Harvey's theory of blood circulation.
These difficulties aroused a great deal of curiosity about muscular movements
and are one of the reasons why Galvani and Volta's discovery in 1800 that
electrical currents could cause muscles to contract, was immediately regarded as
momentous.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, of course, the wild speculations of the early mechanists gave way
to well supported theories. Though it was not until 1950 that Hodgkins
and Huxley described the processes by which neurons built up electric voltage
differences and propagated changes in that voltage from axon's to dendrites by
means of the selective permeability of cell membranes. Even today we still do
not have a definitive account of these processes, with some current researchers
contending that nerve impulses are not purely electrical but have a mechanical
component after all (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2019.00208">Thinking About the Nerve Impulse: The Prospects for the Development of a Comprehensive Account of Nerve Impulse Propagation</a>, 2019)
</p>

<p>
In any case, it is clear that many people now <em>know</em>, what mechanistic natural
philosophers such as Galileo, Descartes and Hobbes may only have <em>believed</em>,
viz., that the surfaces of well lit middle sized objects such as tables and
chairs are radically different to the streams of particles travelling from those
surfaces to our eyes, which are again radically different to what happens at the
backs of our eyes as they are stuck by those particles, which is again radically
different to the impulses sent from our eyes to parts of the brain, which is
again different from the activity in our brains (and if that gives rise to
mental entities or properties such as qualia or sensations then those are yet
different again).
</p>

<p>
The question of when these beliefs were transmuted into knowledge (if indeed
there was any such point in the life of any individual or community) does not
concern us here.  Whether the theories of the mechanistic natural philosophers
are applauded as attempts to explain the physiological processes of sensation
and bodily movement using the same fundamental principles that they had thought
governed the rest of nature; or derided as restricted to an implausibly austere
range of fundamental interactions too limited to do justice to either humans or
nature; speculative belief in mechanistic theories eventually led to and was
replaced by belief in the well supported empirical theories of modern science.
The empirical successes of those theories has irretrivably shattered the illusion
that our minds have anything remotely describable as direct contact with the
properties of the objects around us. The loss of that illusion takes with it the
traditional account of reasoning that had explained our capacity for insight
into the modal relationships between the properties of the objects around us.
</p>

<p>
For a while, it was thought that the old account of knowledge might yet be true
of knowledge of one's own psychological states. Hope lingered that mental
objects might be known with the same certainty and directness that had been
attributed to our knowledge of the properties presented in our sensations of
objects in the external world.  One effect of this was a sense that philosophy
was more closely connected to psychology than to other sciences. But even this
remaining illusion largely collapsed in the face of Freud's theories and the
(which even if they were wildly wrong, made it plausible that our
introspective knowledge of our own mental states was fallible) and the
subsequent development of causal psychological theories.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the <a href="main_introduction.html#1st problem: the justification of scientific theories">first problem</a>, which merely implied that the traditional account of
knowledge and reasoning was incomplete, the new discoveries about the
physiological processes underpinning sensation are outright incompatible with
the traditional account. If the properties of our sensations and thoughts are
not the same as the properties of the objects they represent then the
traditional account of knowledge is false. In particular, the traditional
explanation of the consonance between the properties we can combine <q>in the
intellect</q> and the combinations of properties that external objects can
realise collapses (see <a class="heavy" href="perceptual_invariants.html">perceptual_invariants</a>).
</p>

<p>
The incompatibility of the new understanding of the physiological processes
underpinning sensation with the ancient account of knowledge and reasoning does
not compel scepticism about our ability to reason.  Even if the
traditional account is false and we have no better alternative to offer in its
place, that does not imply that we cannot distinguish good from bad reasoning,
nor that we cannot reason our way to justified beliefs, but only that we are
ignorant of how we have these abilities. The lack of a plausible
epistemology no more casts doubt on our capacity to reason than ignorance of the
physiology of the eye casts doubt on our ability to see. However, in both cases a
deeper understanding of the processes involved can give greater insight into
when they are liable to go wrong, and make us more able to spot charlatans;
and in neither case is the naive account of how these processes function or what
they reveal to us beyond question.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a far more fundamental conflict between our understanding of
ourselves as creatures whose physiology obeys the same physical principles as
the rest of the natural world, and our understanding of ourselves as reasoning
beings that does threaten scepticism.

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-2nd problem: the content of scientific theories-insensitive to necessity and possibility"><h4 id="insensitive to necessity and possibility" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-2nd problem: the content of scientific theories-insensitive to necessity and possibility">insensitive to necessity and possibility</a></h4></div>
<p>
With the doubtful exception of quantum mechanics, all the objects described in
our scientific theories are utterly unresponsive to mere possibilities. The
moving bodies postulated in both Newtonian mechanics and general relativity
alter their velocity only in response to actual forces such as the impact of
another object, the influence of a magnetic field or of gravitation.  The mere
possibility that an object might be struck or the possibility of magnetic flux
has no effect upon such bodies whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
In reasoning, at least as it has been understood in the European philosophical
tradition since the time of the ancient Greeks till today, we appear to have
access to truths concerning possibility and necessity. Reason reveals to us not
only that each triangle's internal angles sum to two right angles, but that
they <em>must</em> do so. On the other hand, the merest possibility of rain tomorrow
may motivate us to take an umbrella.  The latter may be explicable as a mere
appearance. The apparent influence of a future possibility may, upon further
reflection, be attributed to the effect of various actual objects and events
present and past; the looming of dark clouds, the weather reporter's confident
assertion that it will rain and so on. In the case of our ability to reason,
however, our sensitivity to modal truths is not so easily dismissed.  An
argument is valid just in case it is impossible for its premises to be true and
its conclusion false; and reasoning is supposed, amongst other things, to enable
us to distinguish valid from invalid arguments.
</p>

<p>
In our reasoning capacities we appear to display a sensitivity to possibility
and necessity that is unlike any of the objects revealed to us by scientific
discoveries. It thus seems impossible for reasoning beings such as ourselves to
be made from the modally insensitive materials postulated in science.

<p>
As awareness of these problems spread, there was a curious inversion in where
the center of the difficulty was supposed to lie:
</p>

<p>
At first the chief difficulty was thought to be our knowledge of contingent
external objects via the senses. As various mechanistic accounts of sensoruy
organs were proposede it was clear that those senses might respond to objects
quite other than we supposed them to be. <a href="descartes.html">Descartes'</a> concern was
that the senses are dubious and he sought after certain reason for trusting
them. By contrast he took our knowledge of truths of mathematics, and of truths
underpinning valid arguments such as his cogito to be induibitable<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Descartes is inconstant on this point. Sometimes he asserts that it is within God's power to deceive us even about such truths.  This even engenders a well known circularity in Descartes' arguments.  But God's power to deceive us about such truths remains an afterthought for Descartes, intended to ensure compatibility with God's omnipotence. By contrast, the main conclusion of the cogito is that we can trust the senses only because the existence of a God who does not deceive us can be <em>deduced</em> from the certain knowledge of one's own existence and thoughts</span></span>:
</p>
<blockquote>
let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am
nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something; or make it true at
some future time that I have never existed, since it is now true that I
exist; or bring it about that two and three added together are more or less
than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction.
(<a href="../zz.texts/descartes2.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf">Third Meditation</a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
As the conflict between our scientific knowledge and our understanding of
ourselves as reasoning beings became more apparent, however, it was our
knowledge of necessary truths that appeared more difficult to explain. In the
case of knowledge justified by experience there is, at least when things go
well, a causal chain running from external objects via experiences to the
formation of beliefs true of those objects.  Modern philosophers may delight in
considering abberant cases, despair because causal necessity is not strong
enough to support knowledge according to the traditional view, debate analyses
of counterfactuals or deny that there are beliefs at all; but there is an
undeniable comfort to be drawn from the fact that, at least under some fairly
common conditions, if a belief justified by experience were not true then it
would not be believed.  By contrast the lack of any such connection between
necessary truths and the formation of our beliefs in those truths came to be
seen as increasingly problematic.
</p>

<p>
Viewed upon a larger scale, the new focus on the justification of knowledge of
necessary truths was a reversion to the ancient order.  Explaining our knowledge
of necessary truths, whether of mathematics, physics or biology, was the central
goal of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning. Not because the
ancient proponents of the traditional view thought the empirical justification
of knowledge of contingent truths was straightforward, but because they held
certain knowledge of necessary truths to be the only sort of knowledge worth
considering.
</p>

<p>
Whether the modern attempts to explain the justification of the knowledge of
necessary truths is regarded as a new response to an unprecedented crisis
created by the mismatch between scientific discoveries and the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning, or as the continuation of an ancient
enquiry; the manifest falsehood of traditional epistemology left us without any
coherent account of the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths, and
the search for such an account became the central task of philosophy.

<p>
Although <a href="Descartes.html">Descartes</a> was among the first to note that the traditional
account of the justification of knowledge did not apply to our knowledge of
scientific truths, he did not give an account of our ability to reason (or
otherwise discern necessary truths). In his
<em>Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason</em> he gave general
advice on how to approach broadly mathematical and scientific questions<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Along the lines of: take nothing for granted, divide problems into smaller problems</span></span>;
but he had faith enough in God, confidence enough in his own abilities, and was
so strongly struck by the sense of <q>seeing clearly</q> that something must be
so, that it apparently never occured to him to venture an account of our ability
to reason beyond attributing it to God's grace.  The British empiricists that
followed him, by contrast, were keenly interested in demarcating the limits of
what reason could accomplish, and hence began to propose various theories about
the process of reasoning.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-locke"><h4 id="locke" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-locke">locke</a></h4></div>
<p>
In his <em>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>, Locke gave an account of
reasoning based on the capacity to <q>see</q> relations between <q>ideas</q>.
Foremost among these relations was identity, and hence among other things,
reasoning was the power to <q>see</q> that <q>that white is not black, that a
circle is not a triangle</q>. Chains of such intuitively discernable identities
gave rise to demonstrative proofs. The resulting account of reasoning applies
nicely to geometrical proofs demonstrating that two lines are the same length
or two angles of the same measure by constructing an intermediate which is shown
equal to both. As Locke himself recognised, however, the capacity to discern the
identity or difference of ideas is not enough to support all our forms of
reasoning: <q>For, since all distinct ideas must eternally be known not to be
the same, and so be universally and constantly denied one of another, there
could be no room for any positive knowledge at all, if we could not perceive any
relation between our ideas</q>. But in any case Locke did not venture any
account of our ability to discern such identities and relations. In such matters
<q>the mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the truth as
the eye doth light, only by being directed towards it.</q> (Locke's analogy with
the immediacy of sight is somewhat ironic, since a scant five pages later he
states a hypothesis regarding the mechanism of sight: <q>supposing the
sensation or idea we name whiteness be produced in us by a certain number of
globules, which, having a verticity about their own centres, strike upon the
retina of the eye, with a certain degree of rotation, as well as progressive
swiftness</q>.)
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-hume"><h4 id="hume" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-hume">hume</a></h4></div>
<p>
<a href="hume.html">Hume's</a> avowed purpose in his <em>Treatise of Human Nature</em> was to <q>introduce
the experimental method of reasoning</q> into the study of what is now called
human psychology. He does not, of course, stoop to perform any experiments,
but rather his intent is to develop a theory which is supported by
observations of human behaviour and thought in the same way that mechanistic
physics and other scientific theories are supported by observations of natural
phenomena.  In particular, Hume claimed that our beliefs in casual relations are
themselves caused by psychological processes responding to causally efficacious
(and hence empirically accessible) properties such as contiguity, succession and
repetition. Those processes, according to Hume, operated merely by custom and
habit rather than reasoning, and provide no justification for confidence in the
beliefs they cause.  Hence, among other things, <q>we cannot give a satisfactory
reason, why we believe, after a thousand experiments, that a stone will fall, or
fire burn</q>; and our beliefs concerning external objects are caused by
sensations rather than inferred from them: <q>belief is more properly an act of
the sensitive, than the cognitive part of our natures</q>.
</p>

<p>
Though Hume is justly renowned as an empiricist and sceptic of causation, in his
most reflective and melancholy moods his skepticism extends far further. Just as
the empirical scientist's confidence in causation is itself caused, but not
justified by her observations of repeated succession, so too is the
mathematician's confidence in his proofs caused but not justified:
</p>
<blockquote>
Every time he runs over his proofs, his confidence encreases; but still more
by the approbation of his friends; and is rais’d to its utmost perfection by
the universal assent and applauses of the learned world. Now ’tis evident,
that this gradual encrease of assurance is nothing but the addition of new
probabilities, and is deriv’d from the constant union of causes and effects,
according to past experience and observation.
</blockquote>
<p>
Just as no perception is caused by a necessary connection between external
events, such as the striking of a billiard ball and its subsequent movement, so
too with our thoughts, we sense only that one thought comes after another and
not that there is a necessary connection between them.
</p>

<p>
Hume's <em>Treatise</em> is thus the first influential attempt to grapple with the
tension between the traditional account of knowledge and causal accounts of
belief formation. Hume recognised, somewhat dimly and intermittently<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">as innovators and discoverers are wont to do</span></span>
that if the formation of beliefs is a purely causal process, and like other
natural causal processes insensitive to modal relations, then we seem
to have no justification for believing in such modal relationships. (In
particular no justification for believing there are <q>necessary connexions</q>
between causes and their effects).  It is not, however, only our belief in modal
truths that is cast into doubt.  According to the traditional view, reasoning is
a process of forming beliefs in response to their modal connections. In
reasoning one infers a belief from others because one <q>sees</q> or somehow
discerns that it <em>must</em> be true if those others are true.  If, on the one hand,
reasoning requires sensitivity to the modal connections between beliefs and the
justification of knowledge requires deriving that knowledge from principles
known with certainty by methods known to necessarily preserve truth, and on the
other hand, our beliefs are formed by causal processes that are utterly
insensitive to modal properties and relationships, then none of our beliefs are
produced by reasoning and none of our beliefs are knowledge.  Hume, at his most
sceptical, accepts something like this argument and concludes that our
understanding, which has led us to a causal understanding of our own minds,
<q>entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence in any
proposition, either in philosophy or common life. &hellip; We have therefore, no
choice left but betwixt a false reason and none at all</q>.

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-kant"><h3 id="kant" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-kant">kant</a></h3></div>
<p>
That Hume woke <a href="Kant.html">Kant</a> from his <q>dogmatic slumbers</q> is a tired cliche,
but it is a tired cliche for good reason. The metaphor has the notable virtues
of being short, vivid, in Kant's words and, not least importantly, true.  Where
Hume had drawn attention to the conflict between naturalistic causal theories
of mind and traditional theories of knowledge and concluded that none of our
beliefs were knowledge, Kant claimed to reconcile the two and thereby defend
our claims to knowledge by the traditional standard.
</p>

<p>
The costs of Kant's proposed reconciliation were high. Gone was all
hope that the properties of objects were as our thoughts and experiences
represented them.  Gone too all hope of reason justifying substantive knowledge
of such objects. Indeed Kant decried the pursuit of knowledge of objects <q>as
they are in themselves</q> as the fundamental error that had prevented
metaphysics from entering <q>upon the secure path of a science</q> capable of
producing knowledge.  Not only was reason incapable of revealing any truth about
<q>things as they are in themselves</q>, but nothing could be known about them
whatsoever. The match between our experiences and our concepts (and the other
technical components of the content of judgements that Kant introduced) however,
could yet be guaranteed and known with certainty.
</p>

<p>
The dismissal of knowledge of <q>things in themselves</q> was integral to Kant's
reconciliation between our understanding of ourselves as both reasoning beings
and as causal systems. Kant acknowledged that causal principles postulated in
empirical scientific theories <q>which properly pertain to sensibility, do
actually threaten to expand the bounds of sensibility until they include
everything, thus threatening even to displace the pure (practical) use of
reason.</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Bxxv</span></span> (i.e. when taken to apply to <q>things in themselves</q> causal
theories leave no place for the exercise of reasoning in determining our
behaviour); But he claimed that this conflict was an illusion, created by
failing to recognise that we can only be justified in believing there to be
causal relationships between <q>things as they appear to us</q>.  The question
of whether <q>I am free in my actions or, like other beings, am led by the hand
of nature and of fate</q> (i.e. whether I am, among other things, free to be
influenced by reason, or like other natural phenomena my actions are causally
determined by brute facts) was to be rejected as one of the unavoidable, but
unanswerable questions which seeks to transcend the bounds of reason and
experience by applying concepts that are properly only applicable to <q>things
as they appear to us</q> to <q>things as they are in themselves</q>:
</p>
<blockquote>
no contradiction arises when we think the same will in both these ways: in
its appearance (i.e., in its visible acts), as conforming necessarily to
natural law and as to that extent not free; yet on the other hand, qua
belonging to a thing in itself, as not subject to that law, and hence as
free.<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Critique of Pure Reason Bxviii</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>
We could not, of course, know ourselves to be free, anymore than we could know
any of our concepts to apply correctly to any <q>thing in itself</q>, but we
were not precluded from entertaining the possibility. So too we could still hope
that our beliefs were, at least sometimes, the product of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not his proposed reconciliation is satisfactory, Kant completed the
<a href="main_introduction.html#a curious inversion">curious inversion</a> noted above.  Where Hume had focused on the lack
of justification for our beliefs about the contingent external world, Kant
focused explicitly on the justification for our beliefs in necessary synthetic
<em>a priori</em> truths.  Kant clearly understood that if any of our beliefs
concerning the external world were to satisfy the traditional requirements for
knowledge, there must be necessarily true first principles in which certain
belief could be justified <em>without experience</em> and from which the rest of our
knowledge could be deduced with the aid of experience.  The method of deduction
was that of Aristotelian syllogistic which (even if it was later found to be
incomplete) could, like the modern logics that supplanted it, be precisely
described in terms of the formal<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">or syntactical</span></span> properties of sentences, and
by that standard was completely clear.  Hence, in Kant's view, the problem of
explaining the justification for our beliefs about the external world
amounted to finding the justification for believing in suitable necessary
<em>a priori</em> principles. Where the traditional Aristotelian view had held the
active intellect to be a faculty for distilling universal properties from direct
encounters with their instances, Kant held reason to be <q>the faculty that
provides us with the principles of <em>a priori</em> knowledge</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Critique of Pure Reason A11</span></span>. Where Aristotelian
first principles concerned the essential properties of external objects and were
learnt from experience, Kantian first principles were known independently of
experience, concerned the fundamental properties of the world
<em>as it appeared to us</em>, and reflected the perceptual and conceptual structure of
our minds rather than the modal structure of the world.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-kant-causes of rejection"><h5 id="causes of rejection" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning-modern attempts to explain knowledge of necessary truths-kant-causes of rejection">causes of rejection</a></h5></div>
<p>
<a href="kant.html">Kant's</a> philosophy had not one, but two heydays, and at its height
its dominance among European philosophers rivalled Aristotle's hold on
European philosophers in the late middle ages. Indeed it was so widely accepted
that it spread beyond the narrow confines of professional philosophy and began
to influence other European social institutions, particularly in Germany.  It is
an essentially conservative philosophy and part of its appeal to
non-philosophical authorities was that it provided a plausible defence for
continued belief in the traditional tenets of European religion and morality in
the face of scientific discoveries that appeared to leave no room for either.
</p>

<p>
There is no single reason why Kant's system eventually fell out of favour.  To
be sure, there were internal problems.  If causation were only a
relationship between <q>things as they appear to us</q>, and never between
<q>things as they are in themselves</q> then those unknowable totally non-mental
<q>things in themselves</q> could not be the causes of the experiences
representing them; and a version of Hume's concern that we had no justification
for believing that our experiences were caused by non-mental objects remained
unanswered after all.  While versions of this criticism led some influential
German philosophers (such as Fichte and Schopenhauer<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself#Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte</span></span>)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself#Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte</span></span>)</a>
to reject Kant's notion of the <q>thing in itself</q>, it was far from a key factor.
</p>

<p>
A more tangible problem was that several of the principles Kant had claimed to
be necessary truths known with certainty and independently of any experience
were later rejected on the basis of empirical evidence.  In particular, Kant had
claimed that the structure of space and time must be Euclidean by virtue of
unalterable fundamental structures in the human mind.  By contrast, according to
Einstein's theory of general relativity space-time was curved and its geometry
utterly independent of any mind. The theory contained various predictions,
most notably concerning the bending of light around massive objects such as
stars, which were subsequently verified. Kant had also claimed that all events
we could experience must be caused deterministically by virtue of the systematic
structure that human understanding gave to our experiences. By contrast, quantum
mechanics made detailed and irreducibly probabilistic predictions about matters
such as the decay of radioactive particles and again those predictions were
repeatedly verified. Even if Kant's system could be modified to render it
compatible with these discoveries, the mere possibility of error in judging
the truth of these principles or even in judging whether or not they were
<em>a priori</em>, threw the foundations of Kant's system into doubt. While these
issues were more compelling than the technical problems within Kant's system,
they were still not a decisive factor.  The relevant empirical discoveries were
largely made after Kant's system had already fallen out of favour. To those who
had already rejected Kant's system they served only as the final nail in its
coffin, while the core of remaining believers were so committed that these
discoveries did little to change their minds.
</p>

<p>
As it turned out, it was a combination of two other factors which had the most
effect in displacing the systems developed by Kant and his followers:
</p>

<p>
The first was the failure of Kant and his followers to deliver on
their promise of a metaphysics that was <q>purified by critique, and estabished
once and for all</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">ibid., Bxxv</span></span>.  One of the central claims of Kant's
<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> had been that it would put an end to those
<q>questions which, by the very nature of reason itself, it is not able to
ignore, but which as transcending all its powers, it is also not able to
answer</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Critique of Pure Reason, 1st edition, 1st page, 1st paragraph</span></span>  by demarcating the limits of human <em>a priori</em> knowledge, making the
justification of our knowledge within those limits clear and putting aside
questions concerning matters beyond these limits as insoluble. Disputes between
metaphysicians were supposed to become as resolvable as disputes between
mathematicians and produce a growing body of established results.
</p>

<p>
It is clear why Kant <em>thought</em> his new system's purified methodology would sweep
away all the old metaphysical disputes (either by determining the grounds for
resolving them or by judging them to be about <q>things as they are in
themselves</q> and hence irresolvable). The rejection of our capacity to have
any insight into the essential qualities of objects and properties as <q>they
are in themselves</q> is a central theme of his <em>Critique</em>. The claims to
knowledge in those irresolvable metaphysical disputes were supposed to rely upon
appeals to that capacity for their justification. Once the illusion that our
sensations and thoughts had the same properties as the objects they represented
was uncovered, and attempts to gain knowledge of <q>things as they are in
themselves</q> were put aside, metaphysics was supposed to finally <q>enter upon
the secure road of a science</q>.
</p>

<p>
It is even clearer, however, that nothing of the sort happened in practice. The
justifications offered for taking the intuitive sense of <q>seeing clearly and
distinctly</q> that a claim was necessarily true as grounds for believing it
certainly changed in the wake of Kant's Copernican revolution. What had
previously been attributed to insight into the essential nature of external
objects and properties gained through repeated experience, was now attributed to
insight into the psychological structures involved in the formation of belief
(such as the <q>form of all possible experience</q>) gained thorough
introspection. Kant had provided a new account of capacity to reason and
distinguish necessary truths but the new foundations of reasoning and modal
knowledge proved just as open to debate as the old.  The supposed ability to
detect necessary truths remained compelling to philosophers who felt it
directly, and incapable of resolving disputes between philosophers.  Regardless
of the technical merits or defects of Kant's system (which remain as disputed as
any metaphysical claim) it was absolutely clear that in practice, disputes over
supposedly necessary <em>a priori</em> principles continued as vigourously and as
irresolvably as ever among those who sincerely and diligently attempted to
follow out Kant's system.
</p>

<p>
The other key factor was technical advances in mathematics and formal logic.
Doubts concerning our ability to discern necessary truths had spread to the
point that they began to affect mathematics.  As one might expect, the study of
non-Euclidean geometry was an active area of mathematical investigation well
before Einstein suggested that the geometry of physical space-time might be
non-Euclidean.  Stemming from ancient attempts to deduce
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate">Euclid's fifth postulate</a> from the other four postulates (or first principles) of
Euclidean geometry, investigations began to be made into mathematical spaces in
which this postulate was replaced with various alternatives. In these
investigations, our visual imagination (which Kant had taken to provide the
ultimate grounds for geometrical truths) was no longer a reliable guide to
deductive consequence and questions of precisely which forms of inference were
allowable in mathematical proofs became increasingly pressing. Partly in
response to such concerns and partly to show that arithmetic was not reliant
upon Kantian intuitions Frege produced his <em>Begriffschrift</em>, the seminal text of
modern logic, in 1879.
</p>

<p>
There were certainly critics of Kant's metaphysics, and of the disputed
speculative theories his followers developed, before Frege's work became well
known.  In the mid-19th century these critics included popular exponents of
materialism, which denied the existence of non-physical objects, and positivism,
which held all knowledge to be about one's own sensations; but these
alternatives did not win wide acceptance among philosophers. Whatever its flaws,
Kant had attempted to draw a distinction between those claims where our reason
was on firm ground and provided knowledge (such as those of geometry) and those
where it led us astray and produced only metaphysical speculation. However much
critics might disagree with Kantian metaphysics, without a principled account
of our knowledge of necessary truths which provided grounds for rejecting the
wild speculations of Kant's followers, but was yet adequate to allow for our
knowledge of the truths of geometry<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Now cast as concerning non-physical spaces.</span></span> and mathematics, alternatives to Kantian
metaphysics appeared equally dependent on their proponents' intuitive
sense of necessity and no unified opposition developed.
</p>

<p>
<q>The new logic</q>, as its English speaking proponents tended to call it,
captured a far wider and more complex range of inferential patterns than the
traditional Aristotelian logic which Kant had declared to be <q>closed and
completed</q> just one hundred years earlier. The inadequacy of Aristotelian
logic for the inferences required in geometry had been one of the instigations
for the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>.  Since the truths of geometry could not be
purely logical truths, there must be extra-logical <em>a priori</em> principles which
were true by virtue of irreducible modal relationships between the concepts they
contained<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">e.g. the relationship between the concept of a straight line, and that of the shortest distance between two points</span></span>, and the intricate system of the <em>Critique</em> was constructed to explain
our knowledge of those principles.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, it was reasonable to hope that the new logic rigourously delinated
all the patterns of inference required for mathematics<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">including both Euclidean and non-Euclidean goemetry</span></span>.  Vindicating that hope
was the chief purpose of Russell and Whitehead's <em>Principia Mathematica</em> which,
for a time after its publication in 1910, was regarded as one of the great
intellectual achievements of the 20th century.  Russell and Whitehead took the
sentences of their system of symbolic logic to be expressing the propositions of
mathematics in explicit notation. The apparent success of their system raised
hopes that the new logical notation could explicitly express the ultimate, but
hidden, structure of the meanings of all the sentences of ordinary langauge.
Once this <q>logical structure</q> was made fully explicit, valid inferences and
necessary truths could be distinguished by their syntax.
</p>

<p>
With a new and seemingly rigourous way of distinguishing between metaphysical
speculation and the solid reasoning exemplified in mathematics, the old Kantian
explanation of our knowledge of necessary truths could finally be abandoned
completely. In place of Kant's explanation of necessity in terms of irreducible
modal relationships between our concepts, the necessity of statements was now
attributed to the <q>logical structure</q> of their meanings. A logical
structure that could be known by the speakers of the relevant language who
presumably knew, or could figure our, the meanings of their statements.
</p>

<p>
Though Kant's philosophy has lost its dominant position among Anglo-European
philosophers it still retains some adherents<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Indeed for reasons discussed ???&gt;below&lt;??? there has been a recent resurgence in Kant's philosophy.</span></span>.  Kant's most
significant lasting influence, however, is the major sociological landmark of
modern philosophy. The divide between continental and analytic philosophy
is between those who, on broadly Kantian grounds, continue to take introspective
awareness of their mental states as a source of knowledge about the necessary
features of the world, and those seek to place tighter, publicly discernable
limits on the claims of reason, in order to deliver on Kant's promise of a
philosophy freed from irresolvable disputes. The former remained closer to the
older humanistic understanding of ourselves, maintain the ambitions of
philosophy to answer seemingly profound  and held that science was at best a partial description of
the world.

<p>
Analytic philosophy is the third and last of the movements since the 12th
century to achieve such dominance over Anglo-European philosophy as to comprise
an orthodoxy. The preceeding Aristotelian and Kantian movements were largely
named and distinguished by their opponents and in hindsight. Hence, though the
influence of those earlier movements' titular figures is undisputed, the
membership and central doctrines of the movements they inspired are subject to
widely varying interpretations. By contrast most analytic philosophers
explicitly identified themselves as such and hence the movement's membership
is comparatively clear.  While the founding figures of the movement naturally predated
the it's name<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">just as christ was not a christian</span></span>, by the middle of the twentieth century there were a multitude
of conferences, journals and university departments specifically catering to
<q>analytic</q> philosophy; and by and large the participants in those
institutions overtly saw themselves and their peers as pursuing a distinctively
different form of philosophy, more narrowly circumscribed, but set on a firmer
footing, more narrowly circumscribed, and freed (it was hoped) from the
irresoluble speculation that had marred its predecessors.
</p>

<p>
Another key difference is that analytic philosophy is named for a methodology,
<q>analysis</q>, rather than a founding figure. The guiding principle of this
methodology was that necessary truths could be discerned, and certain belief in
them justified, only by analysis of their meanings; in brief, <q>All 
necessary truths are analytic</q>. Of course, the nominal agreement this
slogan generally elicited, covered a wealth of disagreements. Disputing
whether the objects to be analysed were meanings, thoughts, facts, propositions,
concepts, public sentences, linguistic conventions, truth-bearers or something
else became one of the movement's central activities and no specific account of
analysis or even what the meanings to be analysed ever commanded general assent
among the movement's members. Despite these disagreements however, there was
widespread agreement that <q>analysis</q> was the only fundamental way in which
belief in necessary truths could be justified<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">derivative forms of justification, such as being told by a trusted teacher, were of course recognised</span></span>, and was hence the foundation of
our ability to reason.
</p>

<p>
The appeal of Analytic philosophy is also comparatively straightforward.
Learning a langauge appears to be a causal empirical process. We seem to learn
to speak and understand natural langauges by observing our linguistic elders,
attending to their feedback on our performances and endless practice with our
peers<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">As anyone who has learnt a second language as an adult can attest</span></span>.  If, say, learning a langauge consisted in learning the meanings of that
sentences in that langauge <em>and</em> there were some distinctive structural property
of the meanings of necessary truths then that would at least explain our
capacity to distinguish necessary truths. But, at least <em>prima facie</em>, it seems
that linguistic competence may explain more than our ability to distinguish
necessary truths it could also 
</p>

<p>
If many seemd to suppose learning a language means tlearnings the meanings of it
sentences, and the

the meanings of the sentences, then our capacity to respond to necessary truths

<p>
Perhaps reliable linguistic performance requires knowing what
expressions mean; perhaps it is the other way around and our capacity to
understand the assertions of others is part of our justification for
believing their assertions, at least some of the
time, but one way or another linguistic competence seems to be connected with
some sort of justification of belief. If the knowledge

If the knowledge, capacity, or whatever it is that underpins linguistic

Surely the sentences we are justified in holding to be true<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">in a given langauge</span></span>

The <em>prima facie</em> promise of analytic philosophy to reconcile our capacity to
reason with our scientific understanding of ourselves as causal systems is
readily understood.

<p>
The appeal of analytic philosophy is straightforward: it offered an account of
our epistemic access to necessary truths. If the movement had a single central
doctrine it was that <q>All necessary truths are analytic</q>.

<p>
Analyticity, whatever it was,
was a causal/structural property of statements, or
or the thoughts they expressed or their meanings.

Indeed an a analytic truth was simply a statement whose truth could be determined
by analysis without recourse to empirical observation.

<p>
, and as such was a property to
which we could have epistemic access and which could influence the causal process of
belief formation.
</p>

<p>
The learning of a language at least appears to be a
straightforwardly empirical process. One learns a language by observing other
speakers and getting feedback on one's own and as a result of those experiences
forms justified (though fallible) beliefs concerning how other speakers

<p>
Frege's claims concerning linguistic meaning are of more than historical
interest and continue to influence and inform the philosophy of langauge to this
day.um to inform. By and large, however, his views on linguistic meaning have
been rejected and superceeded.  During his lifetime Frege's theory of arithmetic
was found to give rise to devastating contradictions, and in the end he returned
to the Kantian account of our knowledge of geometry and arithmetic that he had
spent his life rejecting. But more than anything else, analytic philosophy was
the product of a technological breakthrough. That technology was first
deliberately constructed by Frege and regardless of the fate of the
philosophical positions it was used to support (by Frege and the analytic
philosophers who came after him) his achievement will always be one of
the key landmarks of human intellectual history.
</p>

<p>
Although Frege's motivation was rigour, rather than automation, the individual
steps permitted in his system of logic are so precisely defined that they can be
performed by causal systems responding to the physical properties of the symbols
they manipulate, or in other words, they can be performed by computers. It is
not, however, the rigour of Frege's system that sets it apart from earlier
logical systems but its complexity. The system of logic Frege specified in his
<em>Begriffschrift</em> is the first system of symbol manipulation to reach the level
of complexity achieved by modern computer processors. More technically, Frege's
system is the first to be able to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computably_enumerable_set">computably enumerable</a> sets of formulae
as theorems. This level of complexity is one of the fundamental orienting
landmarks of the field of computational complexity. It is not a transient
boundary that can be surpassed by adding more memory or multiple processors but
reflects the fundamental principles for composing complex computational
processes from simpler ones. Although higher levels of complexity have been
contemplated as mathematical curiosities, no physical process has yet been
harnessed to perform computations at a higher level of complexity and it may be
the case that none ever will. Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation#Quantum_models">quantum computing</a>, at least in its currently
projected models, would only allow tasks to be completed more quickly and using
a handful of <q>q-bits</q> in the place of a polynomially greater amount of
non-quantum computer memory, but not lift us beyond the level of complexity
achieved by Frege's humble notation. To our current knowledge, Frege's system
marks the maximal boundary of the complexity of our theories of the world.  No
known pattern of human reasoning, in any field of enquiry (including
mathematics, and physics) transcends this boundary.

=======
Since the collapse of analytic philosophy, 
a terrible malaise has set in. It has been so long since we had an account of
reasoning that was compatible with our other knowledge about the world, and the
prospect of us finding one seems to dim that we young philosophers have never
known anything else, and have along 
begun to think that this is normal, and perfectly acceptable. 
‘Well, I don’t know how causal entities such as brains grasp abstract entities
but we simply do and we can model that phenomenon!’  as one modern
philosopher puts it<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Matze, 2023</span></span>.

<p>
central not onl;y because of the history, but because the answer to the question
will shape the answers to all the other questions a philosopher may venture.
</p>


<p>
The consolidation of our theories of the world into a consistent and coherent
whole (at least in the sense that they may all be true of the same unitary
world) is a central traditional project of philosophy. The best known pithy
expression of this objective is perhaps Sellars claim that the aim of philosophy
<q>is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang
together in the broadest possible sense of the term</q>. To this end we require
an account of our capacity to reason that is compatible with our scientific
theories of the world (if need be, by deliniating and acknowledging aspects of
ourselves that are omitted from scientific theories).
</p>

<p>
The need for an account of how reason justifies belief goes deeper than merely
reconciling our traditional understanding of ourselves with our latest
empiricially supported theories. Other features and capacities attributed to us
in our traditional theories (the so called <q>manifest image</q> of ourselves)
can simply be rejected altogether. We can, for instance, reconcile our account of free will with our
current scientific theories, if need be, by simply denying that we have free
will at all and supplying an alternative account of the causes of our actions.
So too for the hard problem of consciousness, we may simply deny that we have
qualia or are conscious in the way described in traditional theories, and supply
an alternative account of how there is a way the world appears to us.  Some have
even gone so far as to deny that we possess beliefs at all and have attempted to
provide an alternative account of what lies behind our sincere assertions.
Whether the offered alternatives can do justice to the phenomena the traditional
theories sought to explain is, of course, a matter of debate, but at least in
principle in these other areas the traditional account can be denied. Our
capacity to justify beliefs by reasoning, however, cannot be denied. Not only,
as noted <a href="main_introduction.html#consequences of these differences">above</a>, are principles discerned
by reason indispensible to the scientific theories with which reconciliation is
sought, but the proponents of any of these alternatives will themselves rely on
reasoning to justify their claims. Reason, like intensionality, and unlike free
will, is an indispensible component of our understanding of ourselves.

rely upon it, and hence that objects that are sensitive to reasons and not just

this goal.

======
Comte glossed over the 
Although they rejected Kant's account of our
knowledge of necessary truths they had nothing to put in its place. In his
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#CouPosFriMil"><cite>Course of Positive Philosophy</cite></a> (1830-42) Comte had claimed that
mathematics was the science of distance measurement and like other sciences
its truths concerned contingent regularities in our sensations. J.S. Mill
approached the problem more explicitly, denying that the truths of mathematics
were necessary, and claiming that universal claims (such as <q>All men are
mortal</q> or <q>Each triangles angles sum to two right angles</q>) were mere
reminders of a justified commitment to making real inferences from past
particular observations
</p>

<p>
Attempts were made to avoid this problem. J.S. Mill, for instance, denied that
the truths of mathematics were necessary at all. Holding instead that held that
all <q>real</q> inferences were from particulars to particulars, and that
universal claims (e.g. <q>All men are mortal</q> or <q>All triangles have
internal angles that sum to 180 degrees</q>) were mere reminders of our
justified commitment to making such inferences (e.g. infering from particular
past observations of humans dying that a particular newly observed human will
also die).

<p>
particularly those who are tempted to take option 4 above
</p>

<p>
To a first approximation, the phrase <q>traditional view</q> may be taken as
referring to Aristotle's epistemology, and if the claims made here about the
<q>traditional view of reasoning and knowledge</q> are not reasonable
interpretations of Aristotle's views on epistemology (and have been taken to be
reasonable interpretations of Aristotle's views for large swathes of
European/Arabic intellectual history) then those claims are straightforwardly
false. A positive point to be made in this connection is how well Aristotle's
talk of <em>epagōgē</em> (usually translated as <q>induction</q>) comes out if one
focuses on geometry. That a circle is a group of points equidistant from a
common center, is neither an inductive hypothesis (such as all swans are white)
nor easily read as a definitional truth (such as composite numbers are divisible
by numbers other than themselves and one). It seems reasonable to suppose that
at least one person realised, after repeatedly viewing (more or less rough)
circles and categorising them together, that each circle marks out objects (or
parts of objects) that are (more or less roughly) equidistant from a common
centre; and from time to time the same realisation may occur independently to
other people.  Indeed, it appears to be a defect in <q>definitional</q> accounts
of concepts (according to which the concept of a circle <em>is</em> the concept of a
set of points equidistant from a common centre) that they preclude a person
having the idea of a circle, (i.e.  realising that the circles they saw about
them were all members of a common category and, so to speak, <q>had something in
common</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or in the terms of the traditional view, <em>instantiated the same universal</em>.</span></span> ) without realising this relationship between circles and their
centres (and also rendering the repeated perception of circles, prior to
grasping this definition, irrelevant to coming to have the concept CIRCLE).
</p>

<p>
Now we are going to regard this unreformed talk of <q>the idea of a circle</q>
and concepts, and <q>having things in mind</q> and <q>grasping concepts</q> as
deeply suspicious, and beware of using this way of describing the realisation
that circles are sets of points equidistant from a common centre to smuggle in
some dubious epistemological theory. But nor should we trust any epistemological
theory that makes it impossible to express this point in some form or other. It
may be that there are no such things as concepts, or indeed properties, but
there must be some way to express the claim that someone may conceive of circles
without realising that they (roughly) mark out objects or parts of objects that
are equidistant from a common centre. Indeed achieving this will turn out to
be one of the final tests of the positive account offered in this treatise.
</p>

<p>
For the moment, however, the purpose of this addendum is to head off a certain
tedious kind of objection to the use of the phrase <q>the traditional account of
knowledger and reasoning</q>. This objection is simply that there was no single
unitary traditional view at all, but rather a range of disparate traditional
views across Western (and Arabic) intellectual history, of which no one warrants
being singled out as <q>the traditional view</q>
even Aristotle's, for there are a range of interpretations of Aristotle) . This
is, of course true, but those who make such an objection fail to take their own
account to heart. I accept Quine's claim that views, like stories and musical
themes, are things that simply cannot be counted. One can of course count people
</p>

<p>
and hence that the use of the definite article is no more objectionable that
the use of a plural.
</p>

<p>
Thus by the phrase
</p>

<p>
that views such as this were endemic throughout nearly all of western Arabic
intellectual history from Plato up until Descartes
</p>


<p>
But of the explanation of the manifest image and how our reasoning about the
ordinary objects we find about us, the widley influential views possess the
features attributed above to <q>the traditional view</q>. Or, again, to partly
clarify the the claims made concerning <q>the traditional view</q> by clearly
specifying some conditions that would make them false: if there were a widely
influential view commonly accepted among many philosophers in the Arabic/Western
tradition which offered to explain our capacity to reason, and offered an
alternative account of the justification of our knowledge of the objects around
us, but which did <em>not</em> also hold that 
</p>

<p>
The exclusion of religious views
Non-religious, not because religion is irreivant to the traidtional view, or (as
is obvoously the case with St Aquinas) deeply intertwined with developments in
this view, but because religion rejects the manifest image .
This is not to deny the importance that thinkers such as Ibn Sina, Augustine
and Aquinas placed upon reconciling our knowledge of objects around us through
sensation and reason with theological and religious doctrine. No doubt there
were significant religious thinkers
but to exclude those religious theories according to which the immanent view of
the qworld is radically false.

<p>
Someone who has survived a modern day university arts course, or engaged with
almost any of the academic humanities as they are currently practised, may
naturally suspect that any enquiry into the nature of knowledege and reasoning
must begin by defining its terms, and that those definitions will largely
pre-determine what account we eventually arrive at regarding the nature of
reasoning and knowledge.  That, to put in its crudest form, "It all depends on
what you mean by 'knoweldge' and 'reasoning'".  This view however, is itself a
remnant of the ancient view outlined above, according to which the only way to
arrive at knowledge is by starting with certain principles (reflecting either
the essential properties of objects or our definitions or perhaps both) and then
derive consequences from them. The fact that such approaches are still often
regarded as the pre-eminent method of conducting an intellectual investigation
is both a sign of how the ancient view lingers on in the humanities departments
of academia, and how bankrupt those departments have (often) become.
</p>

<p>
The approach followed here is more akin to an investigation into a new and
only partly understaood observed phenomena.  Rather than starting with
definitions we shall begin with exemplars and search for any underlying
principles that might explain or unite them. 
</p>

<p>
Like the ancients Geometry, the giving of proofs concerning the relative length
of lines, closed figures consisting of such lines and the size of circles and
angles. The proof by which each of us is genuinely convinced that the area of
the square based upon the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the
sum of the reas of the squares based on its other two sides(and not merely brow
beaten into acquiesing with this claim). The argument Socrates presents to the
slave boy in the <a href="Meno.html">Meno</a> oldest exemplar of this kind of
reasoning (in any tradition <span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">While mathematicians in both China and the Indus
valley knew of geometrical truths including Pythagoras's theorem hundreds of
years before the Greeks, in those traditions they were justified by
examples. Iboth chinese mathematicians and those of the
These must all count as reasoning, and
the claims issued must in some sense count as true.
</p>

<p>
Whatever is going in these exemplars had better count as
reasoning.
</p>

<p>
The attitude I am proposing to follow can be couched as a form of
humility. If our philosophical account of reasoning implies that any of the
cases above are not instances of reasoning, or that they do not lead us to
gain justified true beliefs about the world or that those beliefs are not
knwoledge; then it is more likely that our account of knowlege and reasoning is
wrong rather than those cases not being knowledge. Rather than collapsing into
scepticism if the account of reasoning we uncover does not fit our
preconceptions, let us take our amazing success in producing knowledge in
geometry, mathematics, science and everyday life as more certain than any
philosopher's crazy theory.

<p>
It is tempting, at this point, to suggest that the principles of
reasoning are bedrock. That no futher justification is required. But what we are
seeking is not justification. No more than an account of the physical processes
of the eye increase confidence in our vision.
