Kant is the first proponent of the attempt to reconcile our capacity to discern

It would be fair to say that there is a Kant sized hole in the current work. No
serious attempt is made to engage in significant textual analysis

More than any other philosopher
There is a Kant sized hole is the current work.

A misjudgement

<blockquote>
Anyone on first opening either [version of the <a href="critique_of_pure_reason.html">critique_of_pure_reason</a> ]
finds it overwhelmingly difficult and impenetrably obscure.<br>
<br>
The cause for this difficulty can be traced in part to the works that Kant
took as his models for philosophical writing. He was the first great modern
philosopher to spend all of his time and efforts as a university professor
of the subject. Regulations required that in all lecturing a certain set of
books be used, with the result that all of Kantâ€™s teaching in philosophy had
been based on such handbooks as those of Wolff and Baumgarten, which
abounded in technical jargon, artificial and schematic divisions, and great
claims to completeness. Following their example, Kant accordingly provided a
highly artificial, rigid, and by no means immediately illuminating
scaffolding for all three of his Critiques.<br>
