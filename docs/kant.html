Kant is the first proponent of the attempt to reconcile our capacity to discern

There is, in many ways, a Kant sized hole in the current work. Kant is the
developer of the last attempt

Philosophers could not rest content with Kant's fixed list of concepts. But if
Klant could be mistaken about these concepts

there is a modern day antinomy - a problem of continuous acceleration which
arises as a problem of non-deterinism in classical mechanics:

A misjudgement

<blockquote>
Anyone on first opening either [version of the <a href="critique_of_pure_reason.html">critique_of_pure_reason</a> ]
finds it overwhelmingly difficult and impenetrably obscure.<br>
<br>
The cause for this difficulty can be traced in part to the works that Kant
took as his models for philosophical writing. He was the first great modern
philosopher to spend all of his time and efforts as a university professor
of the subject. Regulations required that in all lecturing a certain set of
books be used, with the result that all of Kantâ€™s teaching in philosophy had
been based on such handbooks as those of Wolff and Baumgarten, which
abounded in technical jargon, artificial and schematic divisions, and great
claims to completeness. Following their example, Kant accordingly provided a
highly artificial, rigid, and by no means immediately illuminating
scaffolding for all three of his Critiques.<br>

it is human reason's usual fate, in speculation, to finish its edifice as
soon as possible, and not to inquire until afterwards whether a good
foundation has in fact been laid for it. Then all sorts of rationalizations
are hunted up in order to reassure us that the edifice is sturdy, or,
preferably, even to reject altogether so late and risky an examination of
it. (Critique of Pure Reason B9)
