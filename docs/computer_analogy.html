Many current philosophers hold that Semantic holism, and many of the raft of
doctrines associated with it, such as the indeterminacy of translation,
confirmation holism.
</p>

<p>
While I hope to provide a clear statements of these doctrines, and arguments for
them, it would be helpful to provide a practical examples os langauges,
theories,
</p>

<p>
discussing them purely in the abstract. If, for instance, 
</p>

<p>
Such an example would immediately establish that it the doctrine is both
coherent.
</p>

<p>
This makes it all the more astonishing and satisfying that there are in fact a
plethora of practical examples. Indeed these doctrines are exemplified by the
very devices that most critics have used to formulate their
</p>

<p>
One of the complaints commonly voiced against indeterminacy of translation is
that it is simply a rehashed form of Cartesian skepticism. (Which is, it is
tacitly suggested, a disorder we all recovered from in 2nd year courses in
epistemology.) 
</p>

<p>
Computer languages exemplify all these doctrines. 
</p>

<p>
The langauges we are concerned with contain statements that are <em>about</em> objects
on the far side of epistemic bottlenecks.
</p>

<p>
the interface of a computer is an epistemic bottleneck. It is not a perfect
bottleneck. We can open up the computer, take x-ray images of it. Or more
prosaicly we may have a good idea of the current state of technology and thereby
know that electrical circuits are involved,
background knowledge concerning the consturction of computers (e.g. we might
know that computers contain electrical circuits) or have
read a manual which specifies the internal circuitry or otherwise concerned some
background knowledsge concerning the computers internal components.
</p>

<p>
Now although this is intended to show that confirmation holism, the
indeterminacy of translation is coherent. And hence we need not show that the
claims that we shall use as premises of our argument

Perhaps if all we know, of a computer were its input and output, what sorts of

<p>
It would, therefore, be disingenuous to count the fact that <a href="semantic_holism_trail.html">semantic_holism_trail</a>
and the accompanying doctrine of indeterminacy of translation are both widely
held to be either false, self-contradictory or incoherent as a tribulation for
those, like myself, who espouse the doctrine. 
What
does irritate somewhat, however, is that the very tools which critics use to
formulate their claims that semantic holism is incoherent or self-contradictory,
demonstrate the falsehood of their claims. For those tools provide beautifully
clear examples of semantic holism in action, and are produced by means which
exemplify the indeterminacy of translation. The computers and programs that
nearly all of us use to write our essays and articles provide perfectly clear
practical exemplars of both semantic and confirmation holism, and thereby
demonstrate the coherence of the very doctrines that the critics use them to
decry.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin by lowering expectations. The chief purpose of this essay is to
make perfectly clear . We cannot pass over the fact that these seemingly
abstruse doctrines of the philosophy of langauge are vividly and concretely
true.

<p>
why these fundamental semantic principles have been unwittingly discovered and
exemplified by programmers accounts of 
</p>

<p>
that choice of interpretation being, as QUine would be the first to admit,
arbitrary (since doctrines 
</p>

<p>
Why, <em>prima facie</em>, no practical examples are ??{to be expected}??
</p>

<p>
Let us begin by noting just how far fetched, it appears that any direct examples
of indeterminacy of translation will ever be produced in practice.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin, however, by emphasising just how far-fetched it seems  for
semantic holism implausible it seems that the doctrine of
confirmational holism (and thence semantic holism) and the under-determinacy of
translation is to have any direct and straightforward exemplars. Confirmation
holism is the doctrine that whole theories are the primary objects of
confimation (and infirmation) - and that some sentences (in perfectly good
linguistic standing) do not have confirmation (or infirmation) conditions at
all. If one holds that 
</p>

<p>
The connection between the two is widely supposed to be obscure and dubious, as
is each of the doctrines by themselves.

The same thing is wrong as with the following argument. Turing machines are not
of any greater complexity than DFA. A finite tape TM is = = DFA. Any computation
that is performed can be performed using only a finite amount of tape therefor
only a finite amount of tape is required

What reason do we have for postulating external objects. For what we are
enquiring into is the supposed objects of belief. So a clear understanding of

expectation. It may is possible that the term is . One of the chief indicators
of expectation is that a failure of expectations causes a chengce in subsequent
expectations. So long as things go the way you expect, the way you expect things
to go doesn't change much. Its when one unexpectedly runs into a table in the
dark (or the spanish inquisisition) that ones expectations change.
