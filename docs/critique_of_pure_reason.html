<p>
What do the supposed <q>revolutions</q> in geometry, physics/science and
<q>metaphysics</q> have in common?
</p>

<p>
Geometry:<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.Bxii) The true method [of geometry], so he found, was not to inspect what
he discovered either in the figure, or in the bare concept of it, and from
this, as it were, to red of its properties; but to bring out wehat was
necessarily implied in the concepts he himself had formed <em>a priori</em> and had
put into the figure in thw construction by which he presented it to himself.
. . . what necessarily follows from what he has himslef set into it in
accordance with his concept.
</blockquote>
<p>
This supposed resemblance between the (newly proposed correct method of)
metaphysics and geometry is the least strained.  Here Kant is hining at
the felt defectiveness of Euclid's Elements  to the
Euclid's elements (in a handful of key points) upon 
</p>


<p>
Science: (the most tenuous of the three)<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
They learned that reason has insight only into that which it produces after
a plan of its own, and that it must not allow itself to be kept as it were
in natures leading-strings, but must itself show the way with principles of
judgement based upon fixed laws, constraining nature to give answer
questions of reason's own determining.  Accidental observations made in
obedience to no previously thought out plan can neer be made to yield a
necessary law  which alone reason is concerned to discover.

<div id="on the introduction-division between logic and metaphysics"><h3 id="division between logic and metaphysics" class="header"><a href="#on the introduction-division between logic and metaphysics">division between logic and metaphysics</a></h3></div>
<p>
It is well known that Kant's opinions about the prospect of further developments
in logic was completely wrong
</p>
<blockquote>
(Bviii) It is remarkable also that to the present day this logic has not
been able to advance a single step, and is thus to all appearance a closed
and completed body of doctrine.
</blockquote>
<p>
The developments of Frege to bring logic
up to the level of complexity required to capture recursively enumerable sets of
sentences as theorems is still 100 years off.
</p>

<p>
But more importantly Kant offers to explain this completeness as due to logic
being <q>quite precisely delimited; its sole concern is to give an exhaustive
exposition and a strict proof of the formal rules of all thought, whether it be
<em>a priori</em> or empirical</q>.
</p>

<p>
One wonders what Kant means by <q>formal</q>, surely not the modern view of
rules specified purely in terms of the shapes and sequences of symbols without
reliance unpon their meanings. <q>Strict proof</q> is also somewhat unclear, or
at least foreign to modern logic - how might one <em>prove</em> an axiom of logic,
or offer it any greater cfeedence than it already has? (inference to best
explanation, or because of the fruitfulness of its consequences is urely not
what Kant has in mind.)
</p>

<p>
metaphysical claims one must suppose, are by contrats those in which the
validity of the reasoning, the necessit of th depewnds upon rthe content
content (i.e. the actual pridicate occupying a place ) contrub, 
One hopes that we have a sense of the structure of a thought/judgement. i.e.
that logical laws are those that remain valid when a concept is consisten tly
replaced with another. (wheras there are other non-logical laws which depent
upon the content/nature of the concepts in particualr places. If so then it will
turn out that logical truths are not analytical (unless the notion of
containment is a containment of ligcal structure).

<p>
Kant repeatedly displays his awareness of the threat of self-contradiction in
asserting that we positively know of the existence of objects about which we can
know nothing.
</p>

<p>
Why posit noumena? We need a positive reasom. In the introcudtion the closest we
come is
</p>
<blockquote>
(Bxxvi) But our further contention must be duly borne in mind namely that
though we cannot <em>know</em> these objects as things themselves we must yet be in
position at least <em>think</em> them as things in themselves; otherwise we should
be landed in the absurd conclusion they can be appearance without anything
that appears.
</blockquote>

<p>
This first hint, at least, is not particularly promising, seemign to hinge as it
does on a more or less definitional stop. If these things we experience are not
appearances (and hence have some external/noumenal obejects that they are
appearances of) then let us call them something else. The question then simply
becomes what reason do we have for thinking that our ewxperienfes are
appearances, and to this, as yet, Kant has ventured no answer

(Bxiii) Accidental observations, made in obedience to no previously

<p>
Here we have the ancient refusal to distinguish between causal(/nomological)
necessity and conceptual(/analytic/logical) necessity.
