<blockquote>
(Bviii) It is remarkable also that to the present day this logic has not
been able to advance a single step, and is thus to all appearance a closed
and completed body of doctrine.
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course this turns out to be wrong, the developments of Frege to bring logic
up to the level of complexity required to capture recursively enumerable sets of
sentences as theorems is still 100 years off. But more importantly Kant offers
to explain this completeness as due to logic being <q>quite precisely delimited;
its sole concern is to give an exhaustive exposition and a strict proof of the
formal rules of all thought, whether it be <em>a priori</em> or empirical</q>.
</p>

<p>
One wonders what Kant menas by <q>formal</q>, surely not the modern view of
rules specified purely in terms of the shapes and sequences of symbols without
reliance unpon their meanings. <q>Strict proof</q> is also somewhat unclear, or
at least foreign to modern logic - how might one <em>prove</em> an axiom of logic,
or offer it any greater cfeedence than it already has? (inference to best
explanation, or because of the fruitfulness of its consequences is urely not
what Kant has in mind.)
</p>

<p>
One hopes that we have a sense of the structure of a thought/judgement. i.e.
that logical laws are those that remain valid when a concept is consisten tly
replaced with another. (wheras there are other non-logical laws which depent
upon the content/nature of the concepts in particualr places. If so then it will
turn out that logical truths are not analytical (unless the notion of
containment is a containment of loigcal structure).

<blockquote>
(Bxiii) Accidental observations, made in obedience to no previously
thought-out plan, can never be made to yield a necessary law, which alone
reason is concerned to discover.
</blockquote>

<p>
Here we have the ancient refusal to distinguish between causal(/nomological)
necessity and conceptual(/analytic/logical) necessity.
