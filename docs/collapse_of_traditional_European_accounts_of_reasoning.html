<p>
Long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us to truth. Our minds
contained concepts, and these concepts were either the same as the
properties of the objects around us or at least very similar to them. (Perhaps
in something like the way that an object and its impression in a clay tablet are
similar.) Maybe these concepts were imprinted in our minds through our senses,
or maybe they were perfect forms of which physical properties were imperfect
copies. But in either case there was a consonance between our concepts and the
properties of the objects around us. The sensation felt when touching a flame
was supposed to be similar to the heat which causes the flame to burn, the
weight felt when lifting a stone similar to the weight in the stone which caused
it to resist being pushed, and the color seen when looking at a white patch of
snow similar to the whiteness of the snow.  Because of these direct encounters
with objects' properties we could intuit the fundamental general principles
governing them. 
</p>


<p>
A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the material world around us (i.e. discern God's
ineffable plan)<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Leibniz is perhaps the last influential exponent of this claim.</span></span>; but even limited intellects such as ours could determine
which combinations of properties were possible or impossible by examining which
combinations of concepts we could conceive of <q>clearly and distinctly</q> (in
Descartes' famous phrase).  Objects that could not be conceived, such as round
squares, or triangles whose internal angles did not sum to two right angles,
were impossible.
</p>

<p>
The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume), was geometry.
Geometry taken, not as we now understand it, an investigation into various
non-physical mathematical idealisations, but as the ancients understood it, an
investigation into the spatial properties of physical objects. Geometry was the
exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was taken to show that
reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles imprinted in us by
experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and observation, could produce
substantial knowledge of the necessary structure of the world.  There were, of
course, famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the fallibility of
the senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that our
justifications for beliefs about the external world did not reach the standard
set by geometry.  Rather than challenging the classical theory of knowledge,
ancient skeptics simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.
</p>

<p>
In the European intellectual tradition, philosophers began to note the cracks
heralding the long, unstoppable, collapse of these accounts of reason and
knowledge shortly before 1650. It is, of course, impossible to put a precise
date upon when the collapse began or ended.  At first, awareness of the problems
in the traditional accounts spread piecemeal, and when they were noted they did
not immediately give rise to despair, but rather to various attempts to repair
or resolve them.  The death-knell of the ancient account of reasoning might
reasonably be said to have been struck in 1919, when decisive empirical evidence
was gathered confirming Einstein's theory that physical space was not Euclidean.
But some thinkers had abandoned hope in the old scheme long before this, while
others continued to hold faith in it even after this point (see <a href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html">Chisholm, 1987</a>)
and even in those who officially abandoned it, its influence continues to run
deep.
</p>

<p>
The key factor that caused this collapse, was the undeniable growth in
scientific knowledge. This growth posed two distinct and fundamental problems
for the traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories"><h2 id="first problem: the justification of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first problem: the justification of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
While the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor
known with the same certainty as geometrical principles, it was not preposterous
to cast them as being like geometrical principles in being necessarily true
and known with greater certainty than the observable consequences derived
from them. Both geometrical and physical principles could be held to be made
true by the essential natures of the objects and properties they concerned. On
this view, the Aristotelian principle that heat rises, for instance, is not an
empirical generalisation, but an essential aspect of the nature of heat. An
aspect that may be grasped, by a mind capable of contemplating general laws, in
a flash of cognition after repeatedly observing hot objects. The new scientific
laws, however, could not be made to fit into this mold.
</p>

<p>
At every point, the fundamental generalisations forming the core of scientific
theories are unlike necessary first principles grasped with certainty in a flash
of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant properties.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties"><h4 id="not sensible properties" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties">not sensible properties</a></h4></div>
<p>
To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in scientific
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  By contrast, human sensory organs are
not sensitive to properties such as charge, field strength and spin.
</p>

<p>
Even the attributions of those properties that might be thought to be sensible,
such as wavelength and mass, is often at odds with ordinary sensations.  The
mass of an object, for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is
dependent upon gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras
the former remains unchanged even in micro-gravity. Thus even though we sense
something commonly correlated with mass (perhaps the force exerted on our
bodies), we do not sense the mass of objects.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths"><h4 id="not necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths">not necessary truths</a></h4></div>
<p>
The next difference is that scientific generalisations are not true necessarily.
This claim's most influential advocate may be Popper, for though he did not
argue for it explicitly, it is implied by his well known principle that
scientific claims must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a>.  According to Popper, a statement is
falsifiable if and only if there is a possible <q>basic statement</q> (i.e. a
singular existential claim, such as <q>The needle on this voltmeter is pointing
to 11</q>) whose truth is <q>intersubjectively testable</q> (i.e.  about which
observers can come to agree despite other differences in their beliefs) and with
which that statement is incompatible.  But of course, necessary truths are
compatible with every <q>basic statement</q> and hence, by Popper's standard, no
scientific principle is necessary.
</p>

<p>
Independently of Popper's standard for scientific enquiry, principles such as
the right hand rule governing the movement of charged particles through
magnetic fields have obvious symmetric alternatives that are equally plausible
<em>a priori</em> and yet mutually exclusive. While other principles, such as
<q>Elements with eight electrons in their outer shell are inert</q> seem too
palpably arbitrary to be considered necessary.
</p>

<p>
In the other direction, while we may now be confident that Newtonian mechanics
is false, it is at least implausible that it is necessarily false.  Hence no
scientific theory incompatible with Newtonian mechanics can be necessarily true.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty"><h4 id="not known with certainty" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty">not known with certainty</a></h4></div>
<p>
While Popper formulated his falsification principle in the mid 20th century, by
1650 Descartes had already recognized that scientific claims gained credence
via their success in predicting observations. For several centuries afterwards,
it was only dimly apprehended<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">by everyone apart, perhaps, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes">Reverend Thomas Bayes</a></span></span> that for an experience to give credence to a
hypothesis, <a href="if_some_experiences_confirm_others_must_infirm.html">there must be other possible experiences which would confute it</a>
(hence Popper's emphasis on falsification); but it <em>was</em> widely understood that
belief in scientific theories was justified by their success in predicting
observations and that they were <em>not deducible from</em> (descriptions of) those
observations.
</p>

<p>
There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10; and secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
<em>guarantee</em> the truth of the general scientific principles they support. It
is possible for a supposedly universal law to be vindicated by any finite number
of observations and yet be false.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences"><h4 id="known less certainly than their consequences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences">known less certainly than their consequences</a></h4></div>
<p>
Another point of difference between scientific laws and Aristotelian first
principles, is that scientific laws are known with less certainty than the
particular cases fulfilling them; wheras geometrical and arithmetic laws are
known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they subsume.
</p>

<p>
Most of us, for instance, are more certain that addition is symmetric
(i.e. that for any pair of numbers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> + <em>m</em> = <em>m</em> + <em>n</em>) than that
38974298435982 + 87248912374 = 87248912374 + 38974298435982. A modern view may
ascribe this uncertainty to the difficulty of determining whether the particular
case presented falls under the general rule (i.e.  whether, among other things,
the sixth digit of the last number in the equation just given is the same as the
sixth digit in the first). Plato, by contrast, relied upon a looser and
more complex relationship between ordinary objects and the forms than
instantiation <em>simpliciter</em>; he held that ordinary objects realise forms only
imperfectly<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">see <a class="heavy" href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html#Geometrical figures exist">Chisholm's discussion of geometrical figures</a> for a modern exponent of the view</span></span>.  This shortcoming means that ordinary sensible objects may fail
to fulfill the laws obtaining between the forms they imperfectly instantiate. In
either case the general law is more certain that its exemplification in any
given instance.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, scientific generalisations, even mundane ones such as <q>Blue
litmus paper turns red when immersed in acid</q> are known with less certainty
than particular observations of their instances.  Indeed on the modern view it
follows from fundamental principles of probability that such generalizations
must be less certain than observations of any particular positive instance.
For the falsehood of any of instance would render the universal claim false as
well, and hence the probability of the universal claim must be lower than the
probability of that claim being fulfilled in any particular case where it
applies.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not intuitable as a result of observation"><h4 id="not intuitable as a result of observation" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not intuitable as a result of observation">not intuitable as a result of observation</a></h4></div>
<p>
The final point of difference, which is also the most difficult to make sense of
from the modern viewpoint, is that scientific laws are not grasped in a flash of
insight after repeated sensation. After repeated encounters with circles, one
might in a sudden insight, realise that each is a set of points equidistant from
a centre. After repeated encounters with lines, one may realise that just one
line passes through any pair of distinct points. But one does not, after
repeatedly lifting heavy objects, suddenly realise that the gravitational
constant is 6.6743 +/- 0.00015 x 10<sup><small>-11</small></sup> Newton square meters per square
kilogram.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences"><h3 id="consequences of these differences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences">consequences of these differences</a></h3></div>
<p>
The differences just noted make it clear that knowledge of scientific
generalisations is not justified in the way prescribed by the traditional view.
Such is the tenacity and strength of the traditional view's hold on modern minds
however, that a dawning realisation that our knowledge of scientific truths is
not justified in this way often first manifests itself as skepticism; a denial
that we have knowledge of scientific generalizations at all.
</p>

<p>
So it was for Descartes, though he claimed his skepticism was merely
methodological.  The starting point of his cogito is the realisation that that
our theories of the external world cannot be deduced from observations and
necessary first principles, and hence our knowledge of them is dubious.  This
doubt became known as <q>Cartesian skepticism</q> and went on to become a
central problem of early modern philosophy<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">in Kant's words, <q>the scandal of philosophy</q></span></span>.  By contrast, Descartes subsequent
attempt to place our knowledge of scientific theories on the same solid,
deductive, foundations as geometry and mathematics, was derided as ridiculous by
many of his contemporaries [e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Schoock&amp;oldid=1133182057">Martin Schook</a> (<a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dKxa3gAvWR8C">1643</a>)], and largely
dismissed as a second rate addendum by his successors.
</p>

<p>
So it remains for many philosophy students today, who often leave their first
year encounter with Cartesian skepticism convinced that the take home message of
philosophy is that no-one <em>really</em> knows anything except their own experiences
and perhaps some mathematics; i.e.  truths of which the traditional account of
knowledge remains at least superficially plausible.  Nor is this insistence upon
rejecting all claims of knowledge that are not justified by the lights of the
traditional view limited to pioneers and novices. Russell notes the wide spread
of this skepticism in his complaint that <q>. . . when people begin to
philosophize they seem to think it necessary to make themselves artificially
stupid</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><em>Theory of knowledge</em> from <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203875391"><cite>The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell</cite></a></span></span> (i.e. to reject all knowledge claims apart from those that can be
deduced from their own observations and first principles known with certainty).
</p>

<p>
Such skepticism is not the starting point of this work. Our knowledge of
scientific claims, such as the charge of electrons, the speed of light in a
vacuum (and its invariance), and that massive objects attract each other with a
force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, is far
better supported than the traditional account of the justification of knowledge.
If that traditional account implies that we do not have such knowledge, then it
is the traditional account itself, and not the claims to knowledge it denies
that must be rejected. What we seek is an account of reasoning and knowledge
that is compatible with our having knowledge<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">or whatever positive epistemological state it is held to be, if the term <q>knowledge</q> is reserved for those beliefs justified in accordance with traditional view</span></span> of both scientific generalisations
<em>and</em> the principles underpinning deductive inference.
</p>

<p>
Our mere possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations does not
immediately discredit the traditional account altogether. It does show that
account to be incomplete (i.e. that some knowledge is not justified in the way
that view specifies) but it does not show that <em>no</em> knowledge is justified in
that way. It is compatible with both the traditional account of knowledge, and
our possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations to hold that the
traditional view of knowledge is correct within some limited sphere, but that
there is also further knowledge beyond this sphere, of which it is not correct.
</p>

<p>
If the only problem posed for the traditional account of knowledge by the
growth in scientific knowledge was due to our <em>possession</em> of knowledge that was
not justified according to the traditional account; then this view
would be tenable. In addition to knowledge deduced from first principles known
with certainty there would be knowledge justified by our observations and
scientific methods. As our scientific understanding of the physical processes
underlying perception and belief formation developed, however, it became
increasingly apparent that there was a fundamental conflict between the
<em>content</em> of our scientific knowledge and the adequacy of the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning <em>even within its own sphere</em>.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories"><h2 id="second problem: the content of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories">second problem: the content of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
The first problem for the traditional account of knowledge was simply that we
<em>possess</em> knowledge that is not justified by the lights of that account. The
second problem is that the <em>content</em> of that knowledge is wildly incompatible 
with claims upon which the traditional account of reasoning and knowledge
relied.
</p>

<p>
St. Thomas Aquinas was probably the original, and certainly the most influential
author of the phrase <q>Nothing is in the mind that was not first in the
senses</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or rather, of the Latin phrase of which this is the English translation; viz., <q>Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu</q>.</span></span> but, quite fairly, he attributed the spirit of
this precept to Aristotle. It became a commonplace of medieval scholastic
philosophy, discussed by Bonaventure, Matthew of Aquasparta, and Duns Scotus.
The truth of the dictum does not directly concern us here, what does concern us
is that it makes clear the traditional commitment to our concepts being the same
as the properties presented in our sensations.  Even Plato, who held our
knowledge of the forms to be memories from a previous life in a divine realm
where we had contemplated those forms directly, also held that the poor sensible
copies presented by our senses in this world were yet close enough to spark our
remembrance of their perfect originals. Of course, philosophers being what they
are, these views are riven by further dispute. St Thomas claimed that the
<q>active intellect</q> which enabled us to grasp the universal properties
exemplified in our sensations, was an aspect of individual human intellects;
wheras his predecessor Ibn Sina held there to be just one active intellect
common to all humans, and St. Augustine considered this one common element to be
God's divine illumination. Grouping all these views under the title of <q>the
traditional account</q> is not intended to deny the profound differences between
and amongst Platonists and Aristotelians, but simply to emphasise that the
belief that that our concepts are identical with (or at least similar  to) the
properties of our sensations, was an orthodoxy amongst European and Arabic
philosophers from Aristotle up until Descartes.
</p>

<p>
According to the traditional account, not only were the properties of our
sensations the same as the concepts in our minds, they were also the properties
of the physical objects around us. As Aristotle put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
By a 'sense' is meant what has the power of receiving into itself the
sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be conceived of as
taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a
signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that what produces the
impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its particular metallic
constitution makes no difference: in a similar way the sense is affected by
what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent what in
each case the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has
<br>(<em>De Anima</em> Book II Chapter 12)
</blockquote>
<p>
The colour of the distant red object is, through the light created
transparency of the intervening air, able to impress itself on the parts of
the eye that were sensitive to it. The property present in the sensitive parts
of the eye (and by which those parts are affected) is the very same as the
property of the distant object.
</p>

<p>
This triple identity, between the concepts by which we think of objects, the
forms realised without matter in our sensations, and the forms realised by the
material objects that we perceive and think of, was supposed to ensure that our
concepts <em>are</em> the properties of the objects around us.  In Aquinas' words:
<q>The intellect, by the act of understanding, is made one with the object
understood</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Nam intellectus, secundum hoc quod actu intelligit, secundum hoc fit unum cum intellecto <br> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4544136"><cite>Knowledge According to Aquinas</cite></a></span></span>; or as Cajetan, a later influential commentator on Aquinas put it
<q>to know is nothing else than for the intellect to be [the thing known] and
the species is the form whereby it comes to that being.</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4544136"><cite>Knowledge According to Aquinas</cite></a></span></span> We moderns may
wonder at this somewhat mystical unity between acts of cognition and the objects
cognized<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Aquinas held it to be the same unity as obtains between Jesus, the word of God, and God the father, who is the source of that word.</span></span>, and scholars continue to dispute various interpretations of
Aristotle's account of the relationships between substances, species, forms and
universals; but what is clear, in modern terms, is that the properties possessed
by the objects around us, the properties presented in our immaterial sensations
and the concepts by which we think of those objects were held to be the same.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was because the properties we were manipulating in our imaginations,
memories and intellects were the very same as the properties instantiated by the
material objects around us, that the manipulations we could or could not perform
in thought reflected the combinations of properties that could or could not be
realised in objects outside our minds. Our minds were in direct contact with the
properties of the external world and hence reason, the capacity to abstract
those universal properties from particular instances, could give us insight
into the necessary relationships between those properties.
</p>

<p>
All of these claims were directly, unequivocally and irrefutably discredited by
scientific discoveries.
</p>

<p>
The history of the collapse of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning is complicated by the fact that the traditional Aristotelian theories
of sensation and knowledge were not directly replaced by scientific theories
based upon experiment and observation, but were instead swept away by a wave of
wild armchair speculation with only a tenuous connection to empirical
evidence (see <a class="heavy" href="development_of_atomic_theory_of_matter_and_sensory_signals.html">development_of_atomic_theory_of_matter_and_sensory_signals</a>).
</p>

<p>
At the start of the 17th century Galileo set off a wave of speculative physics
that spread over Europe. Galileo himself certainly believed a variety of
speculative theories, but his most significant discoveries were closely based on
observation and experiment.  His treatise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidereus_Nuncius&amp;oldid=1154096054"><cite>The Starry Messenger</cite></a> (1610)
contained the first report of observations of heavenly bodies made through a
telescope; and his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&amp;oldid=1166797169#Day_three:_Naturally_accelerated_motion"><cite>Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences</cite></a> <span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">The two new sciences being <em>statics</em> [the strength of unmoving structures] and <em>kinetics</em> [the motion of objects].</span></span> (1638)
contained a quantitative description of the distance travelled by
<q>naturally</q> falling bodies<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">i.e. bodies falling solely under the influence of gravity</span></span>, namely that <q>the spaces traversed were to each
other as the squares of the times</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">e.g. a body will fall four times as far in two seconds as it does in one</span></span>, and described measurements he had made of a
bronze ball rolling down an inclined plane that confirmed the claim. His private
notebooks also reveal a wealth of experiments, though these were downplayed in
his published work, where he tended to present his claims as deducible from
first principles.
</p>

<p>
The bodily mechanisms involved in movement and sensation were a particularly
attractive topic of speculation. From the outset Galileo realised that if
mechanistic theories were to be plausible they would have to explain our
sensations of colour, taste and scent as arising from mechanical interactions
between the external bodies and our sensory organs.  Indeed this was the main
focus of his 1623 work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assayer"><cite>The Assayer</cite></a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to inhere, these
tastes, odors, colors, etc., are nothing but empty names; rather they inhere
only in the sensitive body, such that if one removes the animal, then all
these qualities are taken away and annihilated.
</blockquote>

<p>
Hobbes was one such speculator, offering an explicitly mechanistic, albeit
cursory, theory of the transmission of sensory signals:
</p>
<blockquote>
The cause of Sense is the External Body, or Object, which presseth the
organ proper to each Sense, .  . . which pressure, by the mediation of
Nerves, and other strings, and membranes of the body, continued inwards to
the Brain and Heart<br>
<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Leviathan/The_First_Part&amp;oldid=9608826#Chapter_I:_Of_Sense"><cite>Leviathan, Chap. I</cite></a></span></span>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes was another:
</p>
<blockquote>
I would have you consider the light in bodies we call <q>luminous</q> to be
nothing other than a certain movement, or very rapid and lively action,
which passes to our eyes through the medium of the air and other transparent
bodies, just as the movement or resistance of the bodies encountered by a
blind man passes to his hand by means of his stick. [&hellip;]
Hence you will have reason to conclude that there is no need to suppose that
something material passes from objects to our eyes to make us see colours
and light, or even that there is something in the objects which resembles
the ideas or sensations that we have of them.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dioptrique&amp;oldid=1184902374">Optics</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although the paucity of the evidence upon which Descartes and Hobbes based their
speculations is remarkable (as was their aversion to laboratory work) it is clear
that many people now <em>know</em>, what mechanistic natural philosophers such as
Galileo, Descartes and Hobbes may only have <em>believed</em>: The surfaces of well lit
middle sized objects such as tables and chairs are radically different to the
streams of particles travelling from those surfaces to our eyes, which are again
radically different to what happens at the backs of our eyes as they are stuck
by those particles, which is again radically different to the impulses sent from
our eyes to parts of the brain, which is again different from the activity in
our brains (and if that gives rise to mental entities or properties such as
qualia or sensations then those are yet different again).
</p>

<p>
Whether the theories of mechanistic natural philosophers are applauded as the
best explanations of physiological processes of sensation and bodily movement
available at the time; or derided as restricted to an implausibly austere range
of fundamental interactions too limited to do justice to either human behaviour
or natural phenomena; speculative belief in mechanistic theories eventually led
to and was replaced by belief in the well supported empirical theories of modern
science.  The empirical successes of those theories irretrievably shattered
the illusion that our minds have anything remotely describable as direct contact
with the properties of the objects around us. The loss of that illusion takes
with it the traditional account of reasoning that had explained our capacity for
insight into the modal relationships between the properties of the objects
around us.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first problem</a>, which merely implied that the traditional account of
knowledge and reasoning was incomplete, the new discoveries about the
physiological processes underpinning sensation are outright incompatible with
the traditional account. If the properties of our sensations and thoughts are
not the same as the properties of the objects they represent then the
traditional account of knowledge is false. In particular, the traditional
explanation of the consonance between the properties we can combine <q>in the
intellect</q> and the combinations of properties that external objects can
realise, collapses.
</p>

<p>
The incompatibility of the new understanding of the physiological processes
underpinning sensation with the ancient account of knowledge and reasoning does
not compel skepticism about our ability to reason. Even if the
traditional account is false and we have no better alternative to offer in its
place, that does not imply that we cannot distinguish good from bad reasoning,
nor that we cannot reason our way to justified beliefs, but only that we are
ignorant of how we have these abilities. The lack of a plausible epistemological
theory no more casts doubt on our capacity to reason than ignorance of the
physiology of the eye casts doubt on our ability to see. However, in both cases
a deeper understanding of the processes involved can give greater insight into
when they are liable to go wrong, and make us more able to spot charlatans; and
in neither case is the naive account of how these processes function or what
they reveal to us beyond question.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a yet more fundamental aspect of the conflict between our
understanding of ourselves as creatures whose physiology obeys the same physical
principles as the rest of the natural world, and our understanding of ourselves
as reasoning beings, which does threaten skepticism.

<p>
With the doubtful exception of quantum mechanics, all the objects described in
our scientific theories are utterly unresponsive to mere possibilities. The
moving bodies postulated in both Newtonian mechanics and general relativity
alter their velocity only in response to actual forces such as the impact of
another object, the influence of a magnetic field or of gravitation.  The mere
possibility that an object might be struck or the possibility of magnetic flux
has no effect upon such bodies whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
In reasoning, at least as it has been understood in the European philosophical
tradition since the time of the ancient Greeks till today, we appear to have
access to truths concerning possibility and necessity. Reason reveals to us not
only that each triangle's internal angles sum to two right angles, but that
they <em>must</em> do so. On the other hand, the merest possibility of rain tomorrow
may motivate us to take an umbrella.  The latter may be explicable as a mere
appearance. The apparent influence of a future possibility may, upon further
reflection, be attributed to the effect of various actual objects and events
present and past; the looming of dark clouds, the weather reporter's confident
assertion that it will rain and so on. In the case of our ability to reason,
however, our sensitivity to modal truths is not so easily dismissed.  An
argument is valid just in case it is impossible for its premises to be true and
its conclusion false; and reasoning is supposed, amongst other things, to enable
us to distinguish valid from invalid arguments.
</p>

<p>
In our reasoning capacities we appear to display a sensitivity to possibility
and necessity that is unlike any of the objects revealed to us by scientific
enquiry. It thus seems impossible for reasoning beings such as ourselves to
be made from the modally insensitive materials postulated in science.

<p>
Initially, it was the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first of these two problems</a> that appeared most pressing
and received the greatest attention.  As awareness of these problems spread,
however, there was an inversion in where the center of the epistemological
difficulties was supposed to lie and the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#second problem: the content of scientific theories">second problem</a> came to be seen as more
critical.
</p>

<p>
At first the chief difficulty was thought to be our knowledge of contingent
external objects via the senses and it was the nature of the justification of
that knowledge that received the most attention. Descartes' concern was
that the senses are dubious and he sought to show why and under what
circumstances they warranted absolute confidence.  By contrast, he
took our knowledge of truths of mathematics, and of truths underpinning valid
arguments such as his cogito to be indubitable<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Descartes is inconstant on this point. Sometimes he asserts that it is within God's power to deceive us even about such truths.  This even engenders a well known circularity in Descartes' arguments.  But God's power to deceive us about such truths remains an afterthought for Descartes, intended to ensure compatibility with God's omnipotence. By contrast, the main conclusion of the cogito is that we can trust the senses only because the existence of a God who does not deceive us can be <em>deduced</em> from the certain knowledge of one's own existence and thoughts</span></span>:
</p>
<blockquote>
let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am
nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something; or make it true at
some future time that I have never existed, since it is now true that I
exist; or bring it about that two and three added together are more or less
than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction.
<br>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511818998"><cite>Third Meditation</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Descartes' reconciliation of the traditional account of knowledge with our
knowledge of scientific theories was never widely accepted. Instead, eventually,
the traditional account of the justification of knowledge by experience was
simply rejected. Though elements of the traditional view lingered long in the
shadowy corners of our languages and intuitions, when considered directly and
explicitly, scientific principles were no longer held to be necessarily
true first principles nor deducible from them.
</p>

<p>
According to the developing scientific theories, the casual connections
between external objects and our experiences were not necessary, nor did they
simply imprint the properties of external objects onto our sensations.
Nevertheless, it was still accepted that that there were, at least when things
went well, causal chains running from external objects, via experiences, to the
formation of beliefs true of those objects.  Once attempts to tighten the links
in these chains sufficiently to satisfy the traditional account of knowledge
were abandoned, less stringent standards of knowledge were proposed<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Nozick&amp;oldid=1172878738#Epistemology">Nozick</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_Williamson&amp;oldid=1166387750#Philosophical_work">Williamson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duncan_Pritchard&amp;oldid=1036160614#Academic_studies">Pritchard's</a> proposals are currently the best known.</span></span> that chains
of contingent causation could support (some with less stringent standards of
necessity to go with them<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><q>safety is a sort of local necessity</q> - Williamson, <a href="https://www.amherstlecture.org/williamson2009/"><cite>Probability and Danger</cite></a>, 2009</span></span> ). Of course none of these alternatives was quite
the same as the full strength original, and enthusiastic discussion of their
various shortcomings continues to this day. Doubtful philosophers continued,
however, to find solace in the causal connections between our beliefs and the
objects of which those beliefs were true. According to our best scientific
theories, the empirical evidence which justifies our beliefs in contingent
truths (whether that evidence is taken to be other beliefs, experiences,
stimuli, tracks in the sand or noises in the distance) can causally affect the
formation of our beliefs.  Hence it seems possible for creatures displaying
roughly our level of success in holding only justified beliefs in contingent
truths and assessing the empirical justifications of others' beliefs, to be
constructed from the natural materials described by science.  Although it was
only slowly and reluctantly accepted that our knowledge of contingent truths,
such as those comprising our scientific theories was not justified in the way
specified by the traditional account of knowledge, and the details of just how
our experiences justified that knowledge are still disputed, there did not
appear to be a fundamental conflict between our possession of such knowledge
and our scientific understanding of the world.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the incompatibility between our scientific theories and our
apparent knowledge of necessary truths (and capacity for deductive reasoning)
appeared more pressing and more irresolvable the more it was considered. Our capacity
to gain knowledge of necessary truths seemed both indispensable to and
incompatible with our scientific discoveries. One difficulty is that many
necessary truths (such as those of arithmetic and geometry) appear to refer to
objects that are not located in space and time, which are hence incapable of
playing any part in causing the formation of beliefs about them<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">In the more recent philosophical literature this is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Benacerraf&amp;oldid=1172032726#Philosophical_work">Benecerraf's epistemological problem or Beneceraff's dilemma</a> </span></span>.
Another apparent difficulty is that, despite our frequent errors in reasoning,
we appear to be justified in believing some necessary truths with absolute
certainty. But any causal psychological process by which confidence is produced
will be subject to malfunctioning and hence though it may produce a <em>feeling</em> of
absolute certainty (or at least a feeling that we customarily describe as a
feeling of absolute certainty) absolute certainty could never be justified by
any causal psychological process<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">The point is roughly Hume's, though he draws from this claim the conclusion that we can never have any confidence in our judgements at all:<q>In every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well as concerning knowledge, we ought always to correct the first judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the object, by another judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the understanding. ’Tis certain a man of solid sense and long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire; since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and must still dread the like for the future.</q> <a href="hume1739.treatiseHumanNature.html"><cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite></a></span></span>.  More generally, as noted above, the
objects described in scientific theories appear to be utterly insensitive to
modal relations. As <a href="hume.html">Hume</a> pointed out vigourously and to great effect,
the supposedly necessary connexions between causes and their effects do not,
themselves, cause any experiences in us (or cause our beliefs to change by other
means).
</p>

<p>
The problem is not merely that terms such as <q>knowledge</q> and <q>justification</q>
cannot be translated into the terminology of physics or some other science
(though such a translation would provide a conclusive solution to the
problem).  The term <q>bridge</q> may be untranslatable into the language of
physics<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">One problem is vagueness and borderline cases. Is an ant-bridge a bridge?  A tree that falls across a river but rots away without any creature crossing over it? Another is the seemingly infinitely diverse ways in which bridges might be constructed of physical materials [unless there is some maximum size for bridges].</span></span>, but the capacity of some particular bridge to bear a load of a million tons or survive a one-in-a-hundred-year earthquake is explicable in
purely physical terms. As some current philosophers are wont to say, the
features that make something a useable bridge are <em>grounded</em> by its
physical properties.  There appears to be no such hope of grounding our
sensitivity to modal properties and relations in the physical properties of the
materials from which, according to our current best scientific theories, our
brains and bodies are constructed. Just as it seems impossible to construct a
device for detecting magnetic fields purely from materials utterly unaffected by
magnetism, so too it seems impossible for creatures who are capable of
distinguishing necessary from contingent truths (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Validity_(logic)&amp;oldid=1170722969">valid</a> arguments from
invalid ones) to be constructed purely from materials utterly
unaffected by modal relationships and properties.
</p>

<p>
Appearing initially as a felt need for a guarantee of correspondence between
our concepts and the properties they represent (the starting point for the
traditional account of our capacity to reason) resolving the conflict between
our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings sensitive to modal
connections, and the scientific understanding of ourselves as physical systems
constructed from modally insensitive materials, came to be regarded as the
fundamental problem of philosophy.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-knowledge of necessary truths regarded as the fundamental problem of philosophy-regarded as fundamental by kantian and analytic philosophers"><h3 id="regarded as fundamental by kantian and analytic philosophers" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-knowledge of necessary truths regarded as the fundamental problem of philosophy-regarded as fundamental by kantian and analytic philosophers">regarded as fundamental by kantian and analytic philosophers</a></h3></div>
<p>
Largely because the attempts to resolve this conflict repeatedly failed, many
philosophers are now skeptical of there being any such thing as a fundamental
problem of philosophy. Those attempts not only failed to re-establish rational
foundations upon which grand philosophical systems could be built (foundations
that had been washed away in the collapse of the traditional account of
reasoning) they also cast doubt on the idea of there being an overarching
standard of good reasoning at all. Many philosophers came to view philosophy as
a collection of more or less independent traditions or projects, each with its
own standards for assessing the truth of its practitioners claims; and no way of
judging one project as more central or fundamental than another. Even among
those those who retained hope of finding an overarching standard of reasoning,
some believed that difficulties in distinguishing the necessary consequences of
ordinary assertions were so profound as to raise doubt over whether propositions
(<em>a fortiori</em> philosophical theses and problems) could be clearly distinguished
from one another.  Even if such concerns are well founded, however, they
are largely foreign to modern Anglo-European philosophers prior to the second
half of the 20th century.
</p>

<p>
Since Galileo's publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&amp;oldid=1166797169"><cite>Two New Sciences</cite></a> in 1638, just two movements
have achieved such dominance over Anglo-European philosophy that they may
reasonably be called orthodoxies. The first was founded by Kant and its members
were those whose views were developments, directly or indirectly, of the views
expressed in his works, most notably the <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite></a>.
The second was Analytic philosophy. There have been times when neither
of these movements dominated Anglo-European philosophy, and individual countries
in which, for a time, some other philosophical movement dominated, but no other
movement has come remotely close the same level of international influence
and popularity these two possessed at their heights.
</p>

<p>
Analytic philosophy's dominance amongst American philosophers at the end of the
20th century is described unambiguously by John Searl:
</p>
<blockquote>
Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States
are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in
the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic
philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the
analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism,
existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in
relation to analytic philosophy.<br>
(<em>Contemporary Philosophy in the United States</em> in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/b.9780631219088.2002.00021.x"><cite>The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy</cite></a> 2002
<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Note this doi is not properly maintained by Wiley -
ISBN: 978-0-631-21908-8</span></span> )
</blockquote>
<p>
In other English speaking countries Analytic philosophy held much the same
dominance. In continental Europe, however, while there were small circles of
highly influential Analytic philosophers, the lingering influence of various
outgrowths of Kantianism prevented Analytic philosophy from achieving the
same dominance.
</p>

<p>
Analytic philosophy was named by its own members for an at least nominally
shared methodology (viz., analysis). Its members tended to see themselves as
practicing a form of philosophy distinctively different to those that had come
before, and explicitly identified themselves and their professional institutions
as engaged with <em>Analytic</em> philosophy. Kantianism, by contrast, was named for
its founder, and its members tended to see themselves as engaging with shared
ideas rather than as members of a common movement. Though Kantians celebrated
Kant's <q>Copernican revolution</q> they generally saw themselves as
distinguishing the ambitions of traditional philosophy that could be fulfilled
from those that could not, and fulfilling those that could; as practicing
philosophy, informed by Kant's discoveries, rather than as practicing a new form
of philosophy altogether. Finally, neither Analytic philosophers nor Kantians
regarded the theses proposed by their movements' founding figures as established
truths. Instead, those theses were generally regarded as promising suggestions.
Suggestions that might, with some combination of revision and refinement, be
developed into true theories.  For all these reasons, while the boundaries of
the membership and doctrines of both movements are somewhat vague and porous,
those of Kantianism are more so.
</p>

<p>
Kantianism's boundaries may be less clear-cut than those of Analytic philosophy
but its dominance over the European philosophy of its day is not. By the start
of the 19th century versions of Kant's philosophy were taught in every major
German speaking university and students flocked to his home town of
K&ouml;nigsberg, which was regarded as a shrine of philosophy. Indeed Kant's
philosophy was so highly regarded that his influence extended beyond the narrow
confines of philosophy and his opinions were sought on public affairs<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">see Bird, Otto Allen and Duignan, Brian. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant/Last-years">https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant/Last-years</a> . Accessed 19 December 2023.</span></span>.
Of course, even during the (first) height of Kantianism's dominance (just after
Kant's death in 1804) European philosophy was noted more for its debates than
its points of widespread agreement, but:
</p>
<blockquote>
Remarkably, almost everyone of importance in the debates, apart from the
parties of metaphysics, faith, and common sense, seemed to profess to be
philosophizing <q>in the Kantian spirit</q>.
<br>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CHO9780511975257"><cite>Cambridge History of Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Just as with Analytic philosophy, in its heyday Kantianism was the orthodoxy in
relation to which practitioners of other forms of philosophy had to define their
positions in order to make their work generally accessible to other
philosophers.
</p>

<p>
Both Kantianism and Analytic philosophy were based around accounts of our
knowledge of necessary truths. Each movement's founding figures offered
accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths and claimed that those accounts
would, if fully developed, allow us to distinguish good reasoning from bad, and
thereby put philosophy on a solid footing. Kant claimed that his account of the
justification of our knowledge of necessary truths would <q>serve as the
touchstone of the value, or lack of value, or all <em>a priori</em> cognitions</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Here, as is usual for him, Kant phrases the problem in terms of <em>a priori</em> knowledge, rather than knowledge of necessary truths. However he held that all and only truths known <em>a priori</em> could be known to be necessarily true: <q>any cognition that is to hold <em>a priori</em> proclaims on its own that it wants to be regarded as absolutely necessary</q> (<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a>, Preface A) and <q>if we find a proposition such that in thinking it we think at the same time its necessity, then it is an <em>a priori</em> judgment</q><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a> , Introduction B). Hence, at least by his standards the questions concerning the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths, and our capacity for <em>a priori</em> judgements are equivalent. </span></span>
(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a>, introduction), <q>will make reason secure in its rightful claims and will
dismiss all baseless pretensions</q>(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a>, preface A) and put philosophy <q>on the
secure path of a science</q>(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a>, preface B).  While for his part, Bertrand
Russell claimed that his new form of philosophy <q>introduced the same kind of
advance into philosophy as Galileo introduced into physics, making it possible
at last to see what kinds of problems may be capable of solution, and what
kinds must be abandoned as beyond human powers</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Our_Knowledge_of_the_External_World_as_a_Field_for_Scientific_Method_in_Philosophy&oldid=11530349">russell1914.knowledgeOfExternalWorld</a></span></span>.  According to Russell these
achievements were to be made possible by new methods that would enable
philosophers to <q>obtain results that do not merely embody personal
idiosyncrasies, but must command the assent of all who are competent to form an
opinion</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Our_Knowledge_of_the_External_World_as_a_Field_for_Scientific_Method_in_Philosophy&oldid=11530349">russell1914.knowledgeOfExternalWorld</a></span></span>.
</p>

<p>
If it were just the members of these two movements who regarded explaining our
knowledge of necessary truths as the fundamental problem of philosophy, that
alone would be sufficient to justify the claim that modern Anglo-European
philosophers generally (though of course not universally) regarded this problem
as the fundamental problem of philosophy. But in fact, this view was already
widespread amongst philosophers <em>prior</em> to these movements. These movements
did not achieve their extraordinary influence because they raised concerns about
the nature of such justification, rather such anxieties were already widespread
and these movements became extraordinarily influential because of the
<em>solutions</em> they offered.
</p>

<p>
Each movement grew in popularity while its account of our knowledge of necessary
truths was regarded as plausible, and when that account was discredited it began
to disintegrate. In neither case, of course, was the disintegration
instantaneous. For a time stylistic and social factors continued to act as
unifying forces; but without a unifying approach to explaining the foundations
of our knowledge of necessary truths, their members' senses of what constituted
good philosophical work drifted apart, and they gradually fell into a range of
factions with less and less in common.
</p>

<p>
Members of these two movements were some, but by no means all, of the highly
influential majority of Anglo-European philosophers who believed that an
account of the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths would provide
a touchstone for evaluating philosophical claims and resolving philosophical
disputes; and also that without such a touchstone two <q>awkward facts</q> about
philosophy [as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/arisoc/aow020">Chris Daly (2016)</a> describes them] would continue to be true:
<q>First, no philosophical problems have been solved; second, philosophers
cannot agree about anything beyond that</q>. It is in this sense that modern
Anglo-European philosophers generally came, for a time, to regard providing an
account of the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths as <em>the</em>
fundamental problem of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
If it were only a matter of providing foundations for philosophy this problem
might be resolved (as popular scientists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&amp;oldid=1194043681#Philosophy">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>,
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-consolation-of-philos/">Lawrence Krauss</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hawking&amp;oldid=1193926342#Philosophy_is_unnecessary">Stephen Hawking</a> have suggested) by simply dismissing
philosophy as a source of knowledge altogether. But the lack of foundations for
philosophy is only one aspect of the more general lack of an account of
our capacity to reason that is compatible with our best scientific theories.
The lack of such an account of reasoning is particularly salient in
philosophy because, at least until recently in the Anglo-European tradition,
philosophy was thought of as a field in which knowledge was pursued
<em>by reason alone</em> (i.e. unaided by the senses<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Except, perhaps, for the initial acquisition of the relevant concepts as per the traditional view described <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#second problem: the content of scientific theories">above</a> </span></span> ). But philosophy is not the only
field in which we reason, and our ability to reason about other matters is no
less puzzling than our ability to reason in philosophy.
</p>

<p>
In particular, as many philosophers have noted, scientific theories themselves
rely upon reasoning for their justification. The relationship between science
and philosophy is not like that between modern chemistry and alchemy. Medieval
alchemists may have possessed some knowledge of chemical properties and
reactions buried amongst their superstitions and esoteric theories, but alchemy
has been altogether superseded by chemistry. The methods and principles of
alchemy have been either rejected or justified by means entirely within the
field of chemistry, leaving no residual core of alchemical principles which
modern chemistry relies upon but cannot justify. By contrast, modern science
appears to retain a reliance upon principles supposedly discovered by the
unscientific methods of ancient philosophers<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">One of the more concrete problems with this history is that the full range of logical techniques required in mathematical reasoning was only first adequately and rigourously described in 1879 by Frege</span></span>. Most obvious are the truths of
mathematics and logic, which feature explicitly in scientific theories. More
broadly, however, the relationship between scientific theories and the evidence
that supports them appears not to be itself a matter for scientific
investigation.  Whether a scientific principle or theory is supported by a given
range of evidence seems to be a necessary truth that is itself undiscoverable by
empirical scientific investigation (though scientific investigation may reveal
whether that evidence happens to exist). So it is that both within a limited
sphere that includes at least algebra, geometry and deductive logic, and more
broadly, our knowledge of necessary truths appears to remain indispensable to
the justification of scientific theories and yet apparently unjustifiable by
scientific methods.
</p>




<p>
but the what evidence
At the outset it appeared perhaps that science cold only study material objects
and mental entities such as.
</p>

<p>
the evidence for the existence of such objects came to be seen as incresingly
dubious.
</p>


<p>
Note that even this separation
does not solve the problem of how a purely physcal system could happen to act as
though .
</p>

<p>
could not be explained in naturalistic terms, how is it that a system acting
purely according to natural laws could move  as though it were controlled by a rational mind which made decisions
in which deduction (among other things) played a part.
<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">or go through whatever motions were involved in evaluating the behaviour of
others</span></span>
</p>

<p>
Viewed upon a larger scale, the new focus on the justification of knowledge of
necessary truths was a reversion to the ancient order.  Explaining our knowledge
of necessary truths, whether of mathematics, physics or biology, was the central
goal of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning. Not because the
ancient proponents of the traditional view thought the empirical justification
of knowledge of contingent truths was straightforward, but because they held
certain knowledge of necessary truths to be the only sort of knowledge worth
considering.
</p>


<p>
There again those who find in this difference reason to suppose that the inner
workings of the mind must be forever
mysterious??impenetrable??unfathomable??impervious to scientific investigation. 
</p>

<p>
that we have misdiagnosed what it is we are doing when we are reasoning.

It seems to me that such and such but I had no idea why you should believe me.
We would have no more justification for foisting our opinions on innocent
passers by than psychics (but probably with a much worse inductive track
record).
</p>

<p>
we need either an account of the justification of knowledge of necessary truths
or an account of why reasoning leads to truth that does not rely upon
knowledge of necessary truths

This work can, of course, be read in any order, and it is hoped that an
inquisitive reader might ramble over these interconnected notes in whatever
order satisfies their curiosity. However, if desired, it can be read as a book
in a linear sequence which covers all the main theses and almost all of the
entries.  That order is the following sequence of <q>trails</q>, which are
themselves connected sequenes of entries that build up to advance a distinct

<p>
Some readers may object to the use of the definite description <q>the
traditional view</q>, noting that there was not a single traditional view, but a
range of more and less subtle variations of an (unindividuable) theme.
</p>

<p>
To a first approximation, the phrase <q>traditional view</q> may be taken as
referring to Aristotle's epistemology, and if the claims made here about the
<q>traditional view of reasoning and knowledge</q> are not a reasonable
interpretations of Aristotle's views on epistemology (and have been taken to be
reasonable interpretations of Aristotle's views for large swathes of
European/Arabic intellectual history) then those claims are straightforwardly
false.
</p>

<p>
Lest the reader suspect that this traditional view is some patchwork strawman,
let us note how appealing Aristotle's account of <em>epagōgē</em> (usually translated
as <q>induction</q>) comes out if one focuses on geometry. That a circle is a
group of points equidistant from a common center, is neither an (scientific)
inductive hypothesis (such as all swans are white) nor easily read as a
definitional truth (such as the principle that composite numbers are divisible
by numbers other than themselves and one). It seems reasonable to suppose that
at least one person realised, after repeatedly viewing (more or less rough)
circles and categorising them together, that each circle marks out objects (or
parts of objects) that are (more or less roughly) equidistant from a common
centre; and from time to time the same realisation may occur independently to
other people.  Indeed, it is a defect in
</p>

<p>
<q>definitional</q> accounts of concepts (according to which the concept of a
circle <em>is</em> the concept of a set of points equidistant from a common centre)
that they preclude a person having the idea of a circle i.e.  realising that
the circles they saw about them were all members of a common category and, so to
speak, <q>had something in common</q> (in the terms of the traditional view,
<em>instantiated the same universal</em>). The appears to have the further consequence
of precluding having the capacity to categorise objects as circles without
realising this relationship between circles and their centres. Another
difficulty for such accounts is explaining  the relevance of repeated perception
of circles has to acquiring the concept CIRCLE).
</p>

<p>
Now we are going to regard this unreformed talk of <q>the idea of a circle</q>
and concepts, and <q>having things in mind</q> and <q>grasping concepts</q> as
deeply suspicious, and beware of using this way of describing the realisation
that circles are sets of points equidistant from a common centre to smuggle in
some dubious epistemological theory. But nor should we trust any epistemological
theory that makes it impossible to express this point in some form or other. It
may be that there are no such things as concepts, or indeed properties, but
there must be some way to express the claim that someone may conceive of circles
without realising that they (roughly) mark out objects or parts of objects that
are equidistant from a common centre. Indeed achieving this will turn out to
be one of the final tests of the positive account offered in this treatise.
</p>

<p>
For the moment, however, the purpose of this addendum is to head off a certain
tedious kind of objection to the use of the phrase <q>the traditional account of
knowledger and reasoning</q>. This objection is simply that there was no single
unitary traditional view at all, but rather a range of disparate traditional
views across Western (and Arabic) intellectual history, of which no one warrants
being singled out as <q>the traditional view</q>
even Aristotle's, for there are a range of interpretations of Aristotle) . This
is, of course true, but those who make such an objection fail to take their own
account to heart. I accept Quine's claim that views, like stories and musical
themes, are things that simply cannot be counted. One can of course count people
</p>

<p>
and hence that the use of the definite article is no more objectionable that
the use of a plural.
</p>

<p>
Thus by the phrase
</p>

<p>
that views such as this were endemic throughout nearly all of western Arabic
intellectual history from Plato up until Descartes
</p>


<p>
But of the explanation of the manifest image and how our reasoning about the
ordinary objects we find about us, the widley influential views possess the
features attributed above to <q>the traditional view</q>. Or, again, to partly
clarify the the claims made concerning <q>the traditional view</q> by clearly
specifying some conditions that would make them false: if there were a widely
influential view commonly accepted among many philosophers in the Arabic/Western
tradition which offered to explain our capacity to reason, and offered an
alternative account of the justification of our knowledge of the objects around
us, but which did <em>not</em> also hold that 
</p>

<p>
The exclusion of religious views
Non-religious, not because religion is irreivant to the traidtional view, or (as
is obvoously the case with St Aquinas) deeply intertwined with developments in
this view, but because religion rejects the manifest image .
This is not to deny the importance that thinkers such as Ibn Sina, Augustine
and Aquinas placed upon reconciling our knowledge of objects around us through
sensation and reason with theological and religious doctrine. No doubt there
were significant religious thinkers
but to exclude those religious theories according to which the immanent view of
the world is radically false.

<p>
Someone who has survived a modern day university arts course, or engaged with
almost any of the academic humanities as they are currently practised, may
naturally suspect that any enquiry into the nature of knowledege and reasoning
must begin by defining its terms, and that those definitions will largely
pre-determine what account we eventually arrive at regarding the nature of
reasoning and knowledge.  That, to put in its crudest form, "It all depends on
what you mean by 'knoweldge' and 'reasoning'".  This view however, is itself a
remnant of the ancient view outlined above, according to which the only way to
arrive at knowledge is by starting with certain principles (reflecting either
the essential properties of objects or our definitions or perhaps both) and then
derive consequences from them. The fact that such approaches are still often
regarded as the pre-eminent method of conducting an intellectual investigation
is both a sign of how the ancient view lingers on in the humanities departments
of academia, and how bankrupt those departments have (often) become.
</p>

<p>
The approach followed here is more akin to an investigation into a new and
only partly understaood observed phenomena.  Rather than starting with
definitions we shall begin with exemplars and search for any underlying
principles that might explain or unite them. 
</p>

<p>
Like the ancients Geometry, the giving of proofs concerning the relative length
of lines, closed figures consisting of such lines and the size of circles and
angles. The proof by which each of us is genuinely convinced that the area of
the square based upon the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the
sum of the reas of the squares based on its other two sides(and not merely brow
beaten into acquiesing with this claim). The argument Socrates presents to the
slave boy in the <a href="Meno.html">Meno</a> oldest exemplar of this kind of
reasoning (in any tradition <span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">While mathematicians in both China and the Indus
valley knew of geometrical truths including Pythagoras's theorem hundreds of
years before the Greeks, in those traditions they were justified by
examples. Iboth chinese mathematicians and those of the
These must all count as reasoning, and
the claims issued must in some sense count as true.
</p>

<p>
Whatever is going in these exemplars had better count as
reasoning.
</p>

<p>
The attitude I am proposing to follow can be couched as a form of
humility. If our philosophical account of reasoning implies that any of the
cases above are not instances of reasoning, or that they do not lead us to
gain justified true beliefs about the world or that those beliefs are not
knwoledge; then it is more likely that our account of knowlege and reasoning is
wrong rather than those cases not being knowledge. Rather than collapsing into
skepticism if the account of reasoning we uncover does not fit our
preconceptions, let us take our amazing success in producing knowledge in
geometry, mathematics, science and everyday life as more certain than any
philosopher's crazy theory.

<p>
It is tempting, at this point, to suggest that the principles of
reasoning are bedrock. That no further justification is required. But what we are
seeking is not justification. No more than an account of the physical processes
of the eye increase confidence in our vision.
But rather we want an account of how physical creatures such as ourselves can be
sensitive to such justifications.

Such a view is perhaps the dominant one amongst educated laymen and
scientific researchers. It forms a pleasing story of historical progress and
development. Philosophy, on this view, is a pre-cursor of modern science, its
methods producing genuine knowledge within a limited sphere, but producing
only superstition and false insight when applied beyond those limits. Science,
through the use use of mathematical techniques for precisely describing
empirical observations, and by abandoning the pretense at <em>deducing</em> knowledge
from those observations, has managed to transcend those bounds.
