<p>
Roughly four hundred years have passed since European philosophers had an
account of reasoning that was compatible with their understanding of the world
around them. Just over two generations have passed since the collapse of the
last great philosophical research program devoted to producing an account of
reasoning compatible with highly plausible modern scientific theories. 
This conflict between our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings and our
understanding of the world around us was once thought to be absolutely
intolerable, but sheer time and repeated failure have rendered it unexceptional
In order to rouse ourselves from the numbing effects of failure and familiarity,
let us begin by recalling rosier days when our theories of the world and our
theories of our capacity to reason were compatible.
</p>

<p>
Long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us to truth. Our minds
contained concepts, and these concepts were the same as, or at least very
similar to, the properties of the objects around us. (Perhaps in something like
the way that an object and its impression in a clay tablet are similar.) Maybe
these concepts were imprinted in our minds through our senses, or maybe they
were perfect forms of which physical properties were imperfect copies. But in
either case there was a consonance between our concepts and the properties of
the objects around us. The sensation felt when touching a flame was thought to
be identical to the heat which causes the flame to burn. The weight felt when
lifting a stone identical to the weight in the stone which caused it to resist
being pushed; and the color seen when looking at a white patch of snow identical
to the snow's whiteness. Because of these direct encounters with objects'
properties we could intuit the fundamental necessary principles that governed
them. 
</p>

<p>
A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the Christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the material world around us; but even limited intellects
such as ours could determine which combinations of properties were possible or
impossible by examining which combinations of concepts we could conceive of
<q>clearly and distinctly</q> (as Descartes' often put it<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">quote original latin here????</span></span>). Combinations of
properties that we could not conceive despite our familiarity with them, such
as would be realised by round squares, triangles whose internal angles did
not sum to two right angles, or objects that were both completely red and
completely green, were impossible.
</p>

<p>
The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume) was geometry.
Geometry taken, not as we now understand it, an investigation of various
non-physical mathematical idealisations; but as the ancients understood it, an
investigation into the spatial properties of the physical objects around us.
Geometry was the exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was taken to
show that reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles imprinted in
us by experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and observation, could
produce substantial knowledge of the necessary structure of the world.  There
were, of course, famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the
fallibility of the senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that
our justifications for beliefs about the external world did not reach the
standard set by geometry. Rather than challenging the classical theory of
knowledge, ancient skeptics simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.
</p>

<p>
In the European intellectual tradition, philosophers began to note the cracks
heralding the long, gradual, collapse of these accounts of knowledge and
reasoning around the beginning of the 17th century. It is, of course, impossible
to put a precise date upon when the collapse began and it is, as yet,
incomplete. At first, awareness of the problems in the traditional accounts of
knowledge and reasoning spread piecemeal,
and when they were noted they did not immediately give rise to despair, but
to attempts to repair or resolve them. The death-knell of the
ancient account of reasoning might reasonably be said to have been struck in
1919, when decisive empirical evidence was gathered confirming Einstein's theory
that physical space was not Euclidean. But although it is now generally accepted
that the geometry of physical space is neither Euclidean, nor capable of being
known <em>a priori</em>, the traditional account of reasoning still has devoted
adherents (e.g. <a href="../zz.texts/chisholm1987-truths_of_reason">Chisholm, 1987</a>).
Even today obdurate elements of these traditional accounts continue to restrict
the range of accounts of our capacity to reason thought to be worth considering.
Still, their fall from orthodoxy is clear.  These accounts of knowledge and
reasoning had once been more widely accepted amongst European scholars than any
modern philosophical theory<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><q>Until Descartes, <em>all</em> theories that explained perception as involving some kind of representation claimed that the representation <em>resembles</em> what it represents. Whether the representation is in the sense organ, soul or mind, it is similar to the thing represented in that it instantiates a property which is like, or literally the same as, the represented property.</q><br> <a href="../zz.texts/benYami2015-descartesPhilosophicalRevolution.pdf">benYami2015-descartesPhilosophicalRevolution</a><br>See also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316855102">zz.referenceOnly/adriaenssen2017-representationScepticismAquinasToDescartes</a></span></span>, but by the middle of the 20th century they were
almost equally widely derided by English speaking philosophers as ancient
errors.
</p>

<p>
The key cause of the collapse of confidence in these ancient accounts of
knowledge and reasoning, was the undeniable increase in scientific knowledge,
Which posed two distinct and fundamental problems for the traditional accounts:
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories"><h2 id="first problem: the justification of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first problem: the justification of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
While the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor
known with the same certainty as principles of geometry, it was not preposterous
to cast them as being like geometrical principles in being necessarily true
and known with greater certainty than the observable consequences derived
from them. Like geometrical principles, physical principles could also be held
to be made true by the essential natures of the objects and properties they
concerned. On this view, the Aristotelian principle that heat rises, for
instance, is not an empirical generalisation, but an essential aspect of the
nature of heat. An aspect that may be grasped, by a mind capable of
contemplating general laws, in a flash of cognition after repeatedly observing
hot objects. The new scientific laws, however, could not be made to fit into
this mold.
</p>

<p>
At every point, the fundamental generalisations at the core of modern
scientific theories are unlike necessary first principles grasped with certainty
in a flash of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant
properties.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties"><h4 id="not sensible properties" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties">not sensible properties</a></h4></div>
<p>
To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in scientific
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  By contrast, human sensory organs are
not sensitive to properties such as electric field strength, quantum spin or
quantum color (and if we can sense magnetic fields, our capacity is so
rudimentary as to be debatable. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0483-18.2019"><cite>Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from Alpha-Band Activity in the Human Brain</cite></a>, 2019).
</p>

<p>
Even the attributions of properties that might be thought to be sensible,
such as wavelength and mass, is often at odds with ordinary sensations.  The
mass of an object, for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is
dependent upon gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras
the former remains unchanged even in micro-gravity. Thus even though we sense
something commonly correlated with mass (perhaps the force exerted on our
bodies when we support objects unaided) it seems we do not sense the mass of
objects.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths"><h4 id="not necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths">not necessary truths</a></h4></div>
<p>
Another difference is that scientific generalisations are not thought to be
true necessarily.  This claim's most influential advocate may be Popper, for
though he did not argue for it explicitly, it is implied by his well known
principle that scientific claims must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a>.  According to
Popper, a statement is falsifiable if and only if there is a possible <q>basic
statement</q> (i.e. a singular existential claim, such as <q>The needle on this
voltmeter is pointing to 11</q>) whose truth is <q>intersubjectively
testable</q> (i.e.  about which observers can come to agree despite other
differences in their beliefs) and with which that statement is incompatible.
But of course, necessary truths are compatible with every <q>basic statement</q>
and hence, by Popper's standard, no scientific principle is necessary.
</p>

<p>
Independently of Popper's standard for scientific enquiry, principles such as
the right hand rule governing the movement of charged particles through
magnetic fields have obvious symmetric alternatives that appear to be equally
plausible <em>a priori</em> and yet mutually exclusive. While other principles, such as
<q>Elements with eight electrons in their outer shell are inert</q> seem too
palpably arbitrary to be considered necessary.
</p>

<p>
In the other direction, while we may now be confident that Newtonian mechanics
is false, it is at least not obvious that it is necessarily false<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">????  <a href="contradictions_in_Newtonian_mechanics.html">contradictions_in_Newtonian_mechanics</a></span></span>.
if Newtonian mechanics is not necessarily false then no scientific theory 
incompatible with it can be necessarily true.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty"><h4 id="not known with certainty" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty">not known with certainty</a></h4></div>
<p>
Popper formulated his falsification principle in the mid 20th century, but
Descartes had recognized that scientific claims gained credence
via their success in predicting observations before 1650<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">see <a href="../zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf"><cite>Principles of Philosophy</cite></a> §206: <br><q>Suppose for example that someone wants to read a letter written in Latin but encoded so that the letters of the alphabet do not have their proper 328 value, and he guesses that the letter B should be read whenever A appears, and C when B appears, i.e. that each letter should be replaced by the one immediately following it. If, by using this key, he can make up Latin words from the letters, he will be in no doubt that the true meaning of the letter is contained in these words. It is true that his knowledge is based merely on a conjecture, and it is conceivable that the writer did not replace the original letters with their immediate successors in the alphabet, but with others, thus encoding quite a different message; but this possibility is so unlikely &lt;especially if the message contains many words&gt; that it does not seem credible.  Now if people look at all the many properties relating to magnetism, fire and the fabric of the entire world, which I have deduced in this book from just a few principles, then, even if they think that my assumption of these principles was arbitrary and groundless, they will still perhaps acknowledge that it would hardly have been possible for so many items to fit into a coherent pattern if the original principles had been false.</q><br> That our belief in such is justified by their fit specifically with <q>things manifest to the senses</q> is made clear in the previous section.</span></span>. For several
centuries afterwards, it was only dimly apprehended<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">by everyone apart, perhaps, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes">Reverend Thomas Bayes</a></span></span> that for an
experience to give credence to a hypothesis,
<a href="if_some_experiences_confirm_others_must_infirm.html">there must be other possible experiences which would confute it</a> (hence Popper's
emphasis on falsification); but it <em>was</em> widely understood that
belief in scientific theories was justified by their success in predicting
observations and that they were <em>not deducible from</em> reports of those
observations.
</p>

<p>
There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10. Secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
<em>guarantee</em> the truth of the general scientific principles they support.
The principles of scientific theories are not deducible from the observations
that support them.  Any principle in which belief is only justified by repeated
observation of positive instances may yet be false, no matter how many positive
instances are observed.  Hence, at least according to the traditional theory of
knowledge, our observations cannot justify believing such principle with
absolute certainty.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences"><h4 id="known less certainly than their consequences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences">known less certainly than their consequences</a></h4></div>
<p>
Another point of difference between scientific laws and Aristotelian first
principles, is that scientific laws are known with less certainty than the
particular cases fulfilling them; wheras geometrical and arithmetic laws are
known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they subsume.
</p>

<p>
Most of us, for instance, are more certain that addition is symmetric
(i.e. that for any pair of numbers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> + <em>m</em> = <em>m</em> + <em>n</em>) than that
38974298435982 + 87248912374 = 87248912374 + 38974298435982. A modern view may
ascribe this uncertainty to the difficulty of determining whether the particular
case presented falls under the general rule (i.e.  whether, among other things,
the sixth digit of the last number in the equation just given is the same as the
sixth digit in the first). Plato, by contrast, relied upon a looser and
more complex relationship between ordinary objects and the forms than
instantiation <em>simpliciter</em>; He held that ordinary objects realise forms only
imperfectly<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">see <a class="heavy" href="chisholm1987-truths_of_reason.html#Geometrical figures exist">Chisholm's discussion of geometrical figures</a> for a modern exponent of the view</span></span>. This shortcoming means that ordinary sensible objects may fail
to fulfill the laws obtaining between the forms they imperfectly instantiate. In
either case the general law is more certain that its exemplification in any
given instance.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, scientific generalisations, even mundane ones such as <q>Blue
litmus paper turns red when immersed in acid</q> are known with less certainty
than particular observations of their instances.  Indeed on the modern view it
follows from fundamental principles of probability that such generalizations
must be less certain than observations of any particular positive instance.
For the falsehood of any of instance would render the universal claim false, and
hence the probability of any universal claim must be lower than the
probability of it being exemplified in any particular instance.
</p>

<p>
The final point of difference, which is also the most difficult to make sense of
from the modern viewpoint, is that scientific laws are not grasped in a flash of
insight after repeated sensation. After repeated encounters with circles one
might, in a sudden insight, realise that each is a set of points equidistant from
a centre. After repeated encounters with lines, one may realise that just one
line passes through any pair of distinct points. But one does not, after
repeatedly lifting heavy objects, suddenly realise that the gravitational
constant is 6.6743 +/- 0.00015 x 10<sup><small>-11</small></sup> Newton square meters per square
kilogram.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences"><h3 id="consequences of these differences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences">consequences of these differences</a></h3></div>
<p>
The differences just noted make it clear that our knowledge of scientific
generalisations is not justified in the way prescribed by traditional accounts
of knowledge and reasoning. However, the hold of those traditional views on
modern minds is so tenacious that instead of rejecting them, the first
manifestation of a dawning realisation that scientific truths are not justified
in this way is often scepticism; a denial that we have knowledge of scientific
generalizations at all.
</p>

<p>
So it was for Descartes. Though he claimed his skepticism was merely
methodological, the starting point of his <em>cogito</em> is the realisation that that
our theories of the external world cannot be deduced from observations and
necessary first principles, and hence our knowledge of them is dubious.  This
doubt became known as <q>Cartesian skepticism</q> and went on to become a
central problem of early modern philosophy<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">in Kant's words, <q>the scandal of philosophy</q></span></span>.  By contrast, Descartes' subsequent
attempt to place our knowledge of scientific theories on the same solid,
deductive, foundations as geometry and mathematics (via proofs that God existed
and would not deceive us) was derided as ridiculous by many of his
contemporaries<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">e.g.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Schoock&amp;oldid=1133182057">Martin Schook</a> in his (<a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dKxa3gAvWR8C">Admiranda methodus novae philosophiae Renati De Cartes</a>) </span></span>, and largely dismissed as a second rate addendum by his
successors.
</p>

<p>
So it remains for many philosophy students today. They often leave their first
year encounter with Cartesian skepticism convinced that the take home message of
philosophy is that no-one <em>really</em> knows anything except their own experiences
and perhaps some mathematics; i.e. truths of which the traditional account of
knowledge remains at least superficially plausible. Nor is this insistence upon
rejecting all claims of knowledge that are not justified by the lights of the
traditional view limited to pioneers. Russell bemoaned the wide spread
of this skepticism in his complaint that <q>&hellip; when people begin to
philosophize they seem to think it necessary to make themselves artificially
stupid</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>Theory of knowledge</em> from <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203875391"><cite>The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell</cite></a></span></span> (i.e. to reject all knowledge claims apart from those that can be
deduced from their own observations and first principles known with certainty).
</p>

<p>
???? REWRITE without <q>the starting point of this work</q>
Such skepticism is not the starting point of this work. Our knowledge of
scientific claims, such as the charge of electrons, the speed of light in a
vacuum (and its invariance), and that massive objects attract each other with a
force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, is far
better supported than the traditional account of the justification of knowledge.
If that traditional account implies that we do not have such knowledge, then it
is the traditional account itself, and not the claims to knowledge it denies
which must be rejected. What we seek is an account of reasoning and knowledge
that is compatible with our having knowledge<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">or whatever positive epistemological state it is held to be, if the term <q>knowledge</q> is reserved for those beliefs justified in accordance with traditional view</span></span> of both scientific generalisations
<em>and</em> the principles underpinning deductive inference.
</p>

<p>
Our mere possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations does not
immediately discredit the traditional account altogether. It does show that
account to be incomplete (i.e. that some knowledge is not justified in the way
that view specifies) but it does not show that <em>no</em> knowledge is justified in
that way. It is compatible with both the traditional account of knowledge, and
our possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations to hold that the
traditional view of knowledge is correct within some limited sphere, but that
there is also further knowledge beyond this sphere, of which it is not correct.
</p>

<p>
If the only problem posed for the traditional account of knowledge by the
growth in scientific knowledge was due to our <em>possession</em> of knowledge that was
not justified according to the traditional account; then this view
would be tenable. In addition to knowledge deduced from first principles known
with certainty there would be knowledge justified by our observations and
scientific methods. As our scientific understanding of the physical processes
underlying perception and belief formation developed, however, it became
increasingly apparent that there was a fundamental conflict between the
<em>content</em> of our scientific knowledge and the adequacy of the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning <em>even within its own sphere</em>.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories"><h2 id="second problem: the content of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories">second problem: the content of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
The first problem for the traditional Aristotelian account of knowledge was
simply that we <em>possess</em> knowledge that is not justified by the lights of that
account. The second problem is that the <em>content</em> of that knowledge is wildly
incompatible with claims upon which the traditional account of reasoning and
knowledge relied.
</p>

<p>
St. Thomas Aquinas was probably the original, and certainly the most influential
author of the phrase <q>Nothing is in the mind that was not first in the
senses</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or rather, of the Latin phrase of which this is the English translation; viz., <q>Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu</q>.</span></span> but, quite fairly, he attributed the spirit of
this precept to Aristotle. It became a commonplace of medieval scholastic
philosophy, discussed by Bonaventure, Matthew of Aquasparta, and Duns Scotus.
The truth of the dictum does not directly concern us here, what does concern us
is that it makes clear the traditional commitment to our concepts being the same
as the properties presented in our sensations.  Even Plato, who held our
knowledge of the forms to be memories from a previous life in a divine realm
where we had contemplated those forms directly, also held that the poor sensible
copies presented by our senses in this world were yet close enough to spark our
remembrance of their perfect originals. Of course, philosophers being what they
are, these views are riven by further dispute. St Thomas claimed that the
<q>active intellect</q> which enabled us to grasp the universal properties
exemplified in our sensations, was an aspect of individual human intellects;
wheras his predecessor Ibn Sina held there to be just one active intellect
common to all humans, and St. Augustine considered this one common element to be
God's divine illumination. Grouping all these views under the title of <q>the
traditional account</q> is not intended to deny the profound differences between
and amongst Platonists and Aristotelians, but simply to emphasise that the
belief that that our concepts are identical with (or at least similar to) the
properties of our sensations, was an orthodoxy amongst European and Arabic
philosophers from Aristotle up until Descartes.
</p>

<p>
According to the traditional Aristotelian account, not only were the properties
of our sensations the same as the concepts in our minds, they were also the
properties of the physical objects around us. As Aristotle puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
As we have said, what has the power of sensation is potentially like what
the perceived object is actually; that is, while at the beginning of the
process of it being acted upon the two interacting factors are dissimilar,
at the end the one acted upon is assimilated to the other and is identical
in quality with it.<br>
(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8bh0gh94"><cite>De Anima</cite></a>, Book II, §5)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
By a 'sense' is meant what has the power of receiving into itself the
sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be conceived of as
taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a
signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that what produces the
impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its particular metallic
constitution makes no difference: in a similar way the sense is affected by
what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent what in
each case the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has<br>
(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8bh0gh94"><cite>De Anima</cite></a>, Book II, §12)
</blockquote>
<p>
The colour of the distant red object is, through the light induced
transparency of the intervening air, able to impress itself on the parts of
the eye that are sensitive to it. The property present in the sensitive parts
of the eye (and by which those parts are affected) is the very same as the
property of the distant object.
</p>

<p>
This triple identity, between the concepts by which we think of objects, the
forms realised without matter in our sensations, and the forms realised by the
material objects that we perceive and think of, was supposed to ensure that our
concepts <em>are</em> the properties of the objects around us.  In Aquinas' words:
<q>The intellect, by the act of understanding, is made one with the object
understood</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Nam intellectus, secundum hoc quod actu intelligit, secundum hoc fit unum cum intellecto.<br>Darcy, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4544136"><cite>Knowledge According to Aquinas</cite></a>, 1903</span></span>; or as Cajetan, a later influential commentator on Aquinas put it
<q>to know is nothing else than for the intellect to be [the thing known] and
the species is the form whereby it comes to that being.</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Darcy, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4544136"><cite>Knowledge According to Aquinas</cite></a>, 1903</span></span>
Aquinas held this unity between concepts and properties to be the same as that
obtaining between Jesus, who is the word of God, and God the father, who is the
source of that word. We moderns may wonder at this mystical unity between acts
of cognition and the objects thereby cognized, and scholars continue to dispute
various interpretations of Aristotle's account of the relationships between
substances, species, forms and universals; but what is clear, in modern terms,
is that the properties possessed by the objects around us, the properties
presented in our immaterial sensations and the concepts by which we think of
those objects were held to be the same.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was because the properties we were manipulating in our imaginations,
memories and intellects were the very same as the properties instantiated by the
material objects around us, that the manipulations we could or could not perform
in thought reflected the combinations of properties that could or could not be
realised in objects outside our minds. Our minds were in direct contact with the
properties of the external world and hence reason, the capacity to abstract
those universal properties from particular instances, could give us insight
into the necessary relationships between those properties.
</p>

<p>
All of these claims were directly, unequivocally and irrefutably discredited by
scientific discoveries.

<p>
The history of the collapse of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning is complicated by the fact that the traditional Aristotelian theories
of sensation and knowledge were not directly replaced by scientific theories
based upon experiment and observation, but were instead swept away by a wave of
wild speculation with only a tenuous connection to empirical evidence
(see <a class="heavy" href="timeline-modern_atomism_to_nerve_impulses.html">timeline: modern atomism to nerve impulses</a>).
</p>

<p>
At the start of the 17th century Galileo set off a wave of speculative physics
that spread over Europe. However, although Galileo certainly believed a
variety of speculative theories, his most significant discoveries were closely
based on observation and experiment.  His treatise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidereus_Nuncius"><cite>The Starry Messenger</cite></a> (1610)
contained the first report of observations of heavenly bodies made through a

of a bronze ball rolling down an inclined plane which confirmed his claim. His
private notebooks also reveal a wealth of experiments, though these were
downplayed in his published work, where he tended to present his claims as
deducible from first principles. By contrast the natural philosophers who
followed after Galileo tended to spurn menial laboratory experimentation in
favour of gentlemanly armchair reasoning.
</p>

<p>
The bodily mechanisms involved in movement and sensation were a particularly
attractive topic of speculation. From the outset Galileo realised that if
mechanistic theories were to be plausible our sensations of colour, taste and
scent would need to be explained as arising from mechanical interactions between
the external bodies and our sensory organs. Indeed this was the main focus of
his 1623 work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assayer"><cite>The Assayer</cite></a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to inhere, these
tastes, odors, colors, etc., are nothing but empty names; rather they inhere
only in the sensitive body, such that if one removes the animal, then all
these qualities are taken away and annihilated.
</blockquote>

<p>
Hobbes was one such speculator, offering an explicitly mechanistic, albeit
cursory, theory of the transmission of sensory signals:
</p>
<blockquote>
The cause of Sense is the External Body, or Object, which presseth the
organ proper to each Sense, .  . . which pressure, by the mediation of
Nerves, and other strings, and membranes of the body, continued inwards to
the Brain and Heart<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Leviathan/The_First_Part&amp;oldid=9608826#Chapter_I:_Of_Sense"><cite>Leviathan</cite></a>, Chap. I, 1651)
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes was another:
</p>
<blockquote>
We must take care not to assume – as our philosophers [namely, the
Scholastics] commonly do – that in order to perceive the soul must
contemplate certain images transmitted by objects to the brain; or at any
rate we must conceive the nature of these images in an entirely different
manner from that of the philosophers. For since their conception of the
images is confined to the requirement that they should resemble the objects
they represent, the philosophers cannot possibly show us how the images can
be formed by the objects, or how they can be received by the external sense
organs and transmitted by the nerves to the brain.
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dioptrique&amp;oldid=1184902374"><cite>Optics</cite></a>, 1637, §4 via <a href="../zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf">descartes1-philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes</a>)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I would have you consider the light in bodies we call <q>luminous</q> to be
nothing other than a certain movement, or very rapid and lively action,
which passes to our eyes through the medium of the air and other transparent
bodies, just as the movement or resistance of the bodies encountered by a
blind man passes to his hand by means of his stick. &hellip;
Hence you will have reason to conclude that there is no need to suppose that
something material passes from objects to our eyes to make us see colours
and light, or even that there is something in the objects which resembles
the ideas or sensations that we have of them.<br>
(<em>ibid.,</em> §1 via <a href="../zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf">descartes1-philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes</a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
Although the paucity of the evidence upon which Descartes and Hobbes based their
speculations is remarkable (as was their aversion to laboratory work) it is
clear that many people now <em>know</em>, what mechanistic natural philosophers such as
Galileo, Descartes and Hobbes may have only <em>believed</em>: The surfaces of well lit
middle sized objects such as tables and chairs are radically different to the
streams of particles travelling from those surfaces to our eyes, which are again
radically different to what happens at the backs of our eyes as they are stuck
by those particles, which is again radically different to the impulses sent from
our eyes to parts of the brain, which is again different from the activity in
our brains (and if that gives rise to mental entities or properties such as
sensations or qualia then those are yet different again).
</p>

<p>
Whether the theories of mechanistic natural philosophers are lauded as the
best explanations of physiological processes of sensation and bodily movement
available at the time; or derided as restricted to an implausibly austere range
of fundamental interactions too limited to do justice to either human behaviour
or natural phenomena; speculative belief in mechanistic theories eventually led
to and was replaced by belief in the empirically well supported theories of
modern science. The empirical successes of those theories have irretrievably
shattered the Aristotelian triple identity between the properties of external
objects, our sensations and our concepts, and with it the illusion that our
minds have anything remotely describable as direct contact with the properties
of the objects around us. The loss of that illusion took with it the traditional
account of reasoning that had explained our capacity for insight into the modal
relationships between the properties of the objects around us.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first problem</a>, which merely implied that the traditional account of
knowledge and reasoning was incomplete, the new discoveries about the
physiological processes underpinning sensation were outright incompatible with
the traditional account. If the properties of our sensations and thoughts are
not the same as the properties of the objects they represent then the
traditional account of knowledge is false. In particular, the traditional
explanation of the consonance between the properties we can combine <q>in the
intellect</q> and the combinations of properties that external objects can
realise, collapses.
</p>

<p>
The incompatibility of the new understanding of the physiological processes
underpinning sensation, with the ancient account of knowledge and reasoning,
does not compel skepticism about our ability to reason. Even if the
traditional account is false and we have no better alternative to offer in its
place, that does not imply that we cannot distinguish good from bad reasoning,
nor that we cannot reason our way to justified beliefs, but only that we are
ignorant of how we have these abilities. The lack of a plausible epistemological
theory no more casts doubt on our capacity to reason than ignorance of the
physiology of the eye casts doubt on our ability to see. In both cases, a deeper
understanding of the processes involved may improve our abilities.  Giving us
insight into when they are liable to go wrong and making us less susceptible to
charlatans. But in neither case is the naive account of these processes beyond
question.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a yet more fundamental aspect of the conflict between our
understanding of ourselves as creatures whose physiologies obey the same
physical principles as the rest of the natural world, and our understanding of
ourselves as reasoning beings, which does threaten skepticism.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories-insensitive to necessity and possibility"><h4 id="insensitive to necessity and possibility" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories-insensitive to necessity and possibility">insensitive to necessity and possibility</a></h4></div>
<p>
With the doubtful exception of quantum mechanics, all the objects described in
our scientific theories are utterly unresponsive to mere possibilities. The
moving bodies postulated in both Newtonian mechanics and general relativity
alter their velocity only in response to actual forces such as occasioned by the
impact of another object, the influence of a magnetic field or of gravitation.
The mere possibility that an object might be struck or the possibility of
magnetic flux has no effect upon such bodies whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
In reasoning, at least as it has been understood in the European philosophical
tradition since the time of the ancient Greeks till today, we appear to have
access to truths concerning possibility and necessity. Reason reveals to us not
only that each triangle's internal angles sum to two right angles, but that
it is impossible for them not to do so. On the other hand, the merest
possibility of rain tomorrow may motivate us to take an umbrella.  The latter
may be explicable as a mere appearance. The apparent influence of a future
possibility may, upon further reflection, be attributed to the effect of various
actual objects and events present and past; the looming of dark clouds, the
weather reporter's confident assertion that it will rain and so on. In the case
of our ability to reason, however, our sensitivity to modal truths is not so
easily dismissed.  An argument is valid just in case it is impossible for its
premises to be true and its conclusion false; and reasoning is supposed, amongst
other things, to enable us to distinguish valid from invalid arguments.
</p>

<p>
In our reasoning capacities we appear to display a sensitivity to possibility
and necessity that is unlike any of the objects revealed to us by our scientific
enquiries. It thus seems impossible for reasoning beings such as ourselves to be
made from the modally insensitive materials postulated in our best scientific
theories.

<p>
Initially, it was the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first of these two problems</a> that appeared most pressing
and received the greatest attention from European philosophers.  As awareness
of these problems spread, however, there was an inversion in where the center
of the epistemological difficulties was supposed to lie and the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#second problem: the content of scientific theories">second problem</a>
came to be seen as more critical.
</p>

<p>
At first the chief difficulty was thought to be our knowledge of contingent
external objects via the senses and it was the nature of the justification of
that knowledge that received the most attention. Descartes' concern was
that the senses are dubious and he sought to show why and under what
circumstances they warranted absolute confidence.  By contrast, he
took our knowledge of truths of mathematics, and of truths underpinning valid
arguments such as his cogito to be indubitable<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Descartes is inconstant on this point. Sometimes he asserts that it is within God's power to deceive us even about such truths.  This even engenders a well known circularity in Descartes' arguments.  But God's power to deceive us about such truths remains an afterthought for Descartes, intended to ensure compatibility with God's omnipotence. By contrast, the main conclusion of the cogito is that we can trust the senses only because the existence of a God who does not deceive us can be <em>deduced</em> from the certain knowledge of one's own existence and thoughts</span></span>:
</p>
<blockquote>
let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am
nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something; or make it true at
some future time that I have never existed, since it is now true that I
exist; or bring it about that two and three added together are more or less
than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction.<br>
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511818998"><cite>Third Meditation</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Descartes' attempt to reconcile the traditional account of knowledge with our
knowledge of scientific theories (via God's grace) was never widely accepted.
Instead, eventually, the traditional account of the justification of knowledge
by experience was simply rejected. Though elements of the traditional view
lingered long in the shadowy corners of our languages and intuitions, when
considered directly and explicitly, scientific principles were no longer held to
be necessarily true first principles, nor deducible from them, nor known with
certainty.
</p>

<p>
According to the developing scientific theories, the casual connections
between external objects and our experiences were not necessary, nor did they
simply imprint the properties of external objects onto our sensations.
Nevertheless, it was still accepted that that there were, at least when things
went well, causal chains running from external objects, via experiences, to the
formation of beliefs true of those objects.  Once attempts to tighten the links
in these chains sufficiently to satisfy the traditional account of knowledge
were abandoned, less stringent standards of knowledge were proposed<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Nozick&amp;oldid=1172878738#Epistemology">Nozick</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_Williamson&amp;oldid=1166387750#Philosophical_work">Williamson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duncan_Pritchard&amp;oldid=1036160614#Academic_studies">Pritchard's</a> proposals are currently the best known.</span></span> that chains
of contingent causation could support (some with less stringent standards of
necessity to go with them<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><q>safety is a sort of local necessity</q> - Williamson, <a href="https://www.amherstlecture.org/williamson2009/"><cite>Probability and Danger</cite></a>, 2009</span></span> ). Of course none of these alternatives was quite
the same as the full strength original, and vigorous discussion of their
various shortcomings continues to this day. Doubtful philosophers continued,
however, to find solace in the causal connections between our beliefs<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or at least our assertions.</span></span> and the
objects of which those beliefs were true. According to our best scientific
theories, the empirical evidence which justifies our beliefs in contingent
truths (whether that evidence is taken to be other beliefs, experiences,
stimuli, tracks in the sand or noises in the distance) can causally affect the
formation of our beliefs.  Hence it seems possible for creatures displaying
roughly our level of success in believing only justified contingent statements,
and assessing the justifications of others' beliefs in contingent statements, to
be constructed from the natural materials described by science. Although it was
only slowly and reluctantly accepted that our knowledge of contingent truths,
such as those comprising our scientific theories was not justified in the way
specified by the traditional account of knowledge, and the details of just how
our experiences justified that knowledge continued to be disputed, there did not
appear to be a fundamental conflict between our sensitivity to the justification
of contingent statements (and hence our knowledge of contingent truths) and our
scientific understanding of the world.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the incompatibility between our scientific theories and our
apparent knowledge of necessary truths (and capacity for deductive reasoning)
appeared more pressing and more irresolvable the more it was considered. Our
capacity to gain knowledge of necessary truths seemed both indispensable to and
incompatible with our scientific discoveries. One difficulty is that many
necessary truths (such as those of arithmetic) appear to refer to
objects that are not located in space and time. Objects that are hence incapable
of playing any part in causing the formation of beliefs about them<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">In recent philosophical literature this is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Benacerraf&amp;oldid=1172032726#Philosophical_work">Benecerraf's dilemma</a> or Beneceraff's epistemological problem]] </span></span>.
Another apparent difficulty is that according to the traditional view we are,
despite our frequent errors in reasoning, justified in believing some necessary
truths with absolute certainty. But any causal psychological process by which
confidence is produced will be subject to malfunctioning and hence though it may
produce a <em>feeling</em> of absolute certainty (or at least a feeling that is
customarily described as absolute certainty) no causal psychological process
could ever <em>justify</em> such certainty<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">The point is roughly Hume's, though he draws from this claim the conclusion that we can never have any confidence in our judgements at all:<q>In every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well as concerning knowledge, we ought always to correct the first judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the object, by another judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the understanding. ’Tis certain a man of solid sense and long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire; since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and must still dread the like for the future.</q> <a href="hume1739-treatiseHumanNature.html"><cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite></a></span></span>.  More generally, as noted above,
the objects described in scientific theories, unlike elements of the processes
by which we hold our beliefs to be formed, appear to be utterly insensitive to
modal relations. As <a href="hume.html">????Hume</a> pointed out vigorously and to great effect,
the supposedly necessary connexions between causes and their effects do not,
themselves, cause any experiences in us (or cause our beliefs to change by other
means or indeed cause anything at all).
</p>

<p>
The problem is not merely that terms such as <q>knowledge</q> and <q>justification</q>
cannot be translated into the terminology of physics or some other science
(though such a translation would provide a conclusive solution to the
problem).  The term <q>bridge</q> may be untranslatable into the language of
physics<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">One problem is vagueness and borderline cases. Is an ant-bridge a bridge?  A tree that falls across a river but rots away without any creature crossing over it? Another is the seemingly infinitely diverse ways in which bridges might be constructed of physical materials [unless there is some maximum size for bridges].</span></span>, but the capacity of any particular bridge to bear a load of a
million tons or survive a one-in-a-hundred-year earthquake is explicable in
physical terms. As some 21st century philosophers are wont to say, the
features that make something a useable bridge are <em>grounded</em> by its
physical properties.  There appears to be no such hope of grounding our
sensitivity to modal properties and relations in the physical properties of the
materials from which, according to our current best scientific theories, our
brains and bodies are constructed. Just as it seems impossible to construct a
device for detecting magnetic fields purely from materials utterly unaffected by
magnetism, so too it seems impossible for creatures who are capable of
distinguishing necessary from contingent truths (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Validity_(logic)&amp;oldid=1170722969">valid</a> from invalid
arguments) to be constructed purely from materials utterly unaffected by modal
relationships and properties.
</p>

<p>
Appearing initially as a felt need for a guarantee of correspondence between
our concepts and the properties they represent<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511805042"><cite>The World</cite></a> Opening paragraph: <q>The subject I propose to deal with in this treatise is light, and the first point I want to draw to your attention is that there may be a difference between the sensation we have of light (i.e. the idea of light which is formed in our imagination by the mediation of our eyes) and what it is in the objects that produces this sensation within us (i.e. what it is in a flame or the sun that we call by the name 'light'). For although everyone is commonly convinced that the ideas we have in our mind are wholly similar to the objects from which they proceed, nevertheless I cannot see any reason which assures us that this is so. On the contrary, I note many observations which should make us doubt it.</q></span></span> (the starting point for the
traditional account of our capacity to reason) resolving the conflict between
our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings sensitive to modal
relationships, and the scientific understanding of ourselves as physical systems
constructed from modally insensitive materials, came to be regarded as the
fundamental problem of philosophy.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-knowledge of necessary truths regarded as the fundamental problem of modern philosophy-regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers"><h3 id="regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-knowledge of necessary truths regarded as the fundamental problem of modern philosophy-regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers">regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers</a></h3></div>
<p>
Largely because attempts to resolve this conflict have repeatedly failed,
many philosophers now doubt that there is any such thing as <em>the</em> fundamental
problem of philosophy. Not only have those attempts failed to re-establish
rational foundations upon which grand philosophical systems could be built
(foundations that had been washed away in the collapse of the traditional
account of reasoning) their failure has also cast doubt on the idea of there
being an overarching standard of good reasoning at all. Some philosophers came
to view philosophy as a collection of more or less independent traditions or
projects, each with its own standards for assessing the truth of its
practitioners claims; and no way of judging one project as more central or
fundamental than another.  Even among those those who retained belief in an
overarching standard of reasoning, some believed that difficulties in
distinguishing the necessary consequences of ordinary assertions were so
profound as to raise doubt over whether propositions (<em>a fortiori</em> philosophical
problems) could be cleanly distinguished from one another at all. Even if such
concerns are well founded, however, they are largely foreign to modern
Anglo-European philosophy prior to the second half of the 20th century.
</p>

<p>
Since Galileo's publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&amp;oldid=1166797169"><cite>Two New Sciences</cite></a> in 1638, just two movements
have achieved such dominance over Anglo-European philosophy that they may
reasonably be called orthodoxies. The first was founded by Kant and its members
were those whose views were developments, direct or indirect, of the views
expressed in Kant's works, most notably his <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite></a>.
The second was Analytic philosophy. There have been times when neither
of these movements dominated Anglo-European philosophy, and individual countries
in which, for a time, other philosophical movements have dominated, but no other
movement has come remotely close to the level of international influence
and popularity possessed by these two at their heights.
</p>

<p>
Analytic philosophy's dominance amongst American philosophers in the late
20th century is described unambiguously by John Searl:
</p>
<blockquote>
Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States
are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in
the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic
philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the
analytic tradition — such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism,
existentialism, or Marxism —feel it necessary to define their position in
relation to analytic philosophy.<br>
(<em>Contemporary Philosophy in the United States</em> in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/b.9780631219088.2002.00021.x"><cite>The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy</cite></a><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Note this doi is not properly maintained by Wiley - ISBN: 978-0-631-21908-8</span></span>, 2002)
</blockquote>
<p>
In other English speaking countries Analytic philosophy held much the same
dominance. In continental Europe, however, while there were circles of
highly influential Analytic philosophers, the lingering influence of various
outgrowths of Kantianism prevented Analytic philosophy from achieving the
same dominance.
</p>

<p>
Analytic philosophy was named by its own members for an at least nominally
shared method of gaining knowledge of necessary truths (viz., analysis) and the
unifying claim that analysis was the only means by which ascriptions of
necessity could be justified.  This claim was epitomized in the slogan
<q>All necessary truths are analytic</q>. While this slogan commanded widespread
agreement, accounts of what was being analysed and just how to conduct such
analysis did not. The objects to be analysed were generally held
to be semantic in some sense: concepts, meanings, propositions, sentences, truth
conditions, inferential roles and logical structure were all suggested
candidates. A tremendous variety of theories of meaning were proposed.
Initially these often took the form of attempting to specify how languages fixed
the relationship between symbols and their meanings, but as time went on and
none of these attempts won general acceptance, increasingly sophisticated
accounts of linguistic representation (some of which did not involve the
postulation of meanings) were offered. Indeed, producing and criticising
accounts of linguistic representation was one of the movement's major
activities. Notwithstanding the lack of agreement as to exactly what was being
analysed, members of the movement tended to see themselves as practicing a form
of philosophy distinctively different to those that had come before, and
explicitly identified themselves and their professional institutions as engaged
with specifically <em>Analytic</em> philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Kantianism, by contrast, was named for its founder, and its members tended to
see themselves as engaging with shared ideas rather than as members of a common
movement. Though Kantians celebrated Kant's <q>Copernican revolution</q> they
generally saw themselves as distinguishing the ambitions of traditional
philosophy that could be fulfilled from those that could not, and fulfilling
those that could; as practicing philosophy, informed by Kant's discoveries,
rather than as practicing a new form of philosophy altogether.  Finally, neither
Analytic philosophers nor Kantians regarded the theses proposed by their
movements' founding figures as established truths. Instead, those theses were
generally regarded as promising suggestions.  Suggestions that might, with some
combination of revision and refinement, be developed into true theories.  For
all these reasons, while the boundaries of the membership and doctrines of both
movements are somewhat vague and porous, those of Kantianism are more so.
</p>

<p>
Kantianism's boundaries may be less clear-cut than those of Analytic philosophy
but its dominance over the European philosophy of its day is not. By the start
of the 19th century versions of Kant's philosophy were taught in every major
German speaking university and students flocked to his home town of
K&ouml;nigsberg, which was regarded as a shrine of philosophy. Indeed Kant's
philosophy was so highly regarded that his influence extended beyond the narrow
confines of philosophy and his opinions were sought on public affairs<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">see Bird, Otto Allen and Duignan, Brian. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant/Last-years">https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant/Last-years</a> . Accessed 19 December 2023.</span></span>.
Of course, even during the (first) height of Kantianism's dominance (just after
Kant's death in 1804) European philosophy was noted more for its debates than
its points of widespread agreement, but:
</p>
<blockquote>
Remarkably, almost everyone of importance in the debates, apart from the
parties of metaphysics, faith, and common sense, seemed to profess to be
philosophizing <q>in the Kantian spirit</q>.<br>
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CHO9780511975257"><cite>Cambridge History of Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Just as with Analytic philosophy, in its heyday Kantianism was the orthodoxy in
relation to which practitioners of other forms of philosophy had to define their
positions in order to make their work generally accessible to other European
philosophers.
</p>

<p>
Both Kantianism and Analytic philosophy were based around accounts of our
knowledge of necessary truths. Each movement's founding figures offered
accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths and claimed that those accounts
would, if fully developed, allow us to distinguish good reasoning from bad, and
thereby put philosophy on a solid footing. Kant claimed that his account of the
justification of our knowledge of necessary truths would <q>serve as the
touchstone of the value, or lack of value, or all <em>a priori</em> cognitions</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Here, as is usual for him, Kant phrases the problem in terms of <em>a priori</em> knowledge, rather than knowledge of necessary truths. However he held that all and only truths known <em>a priori</em> could be known to be necessarily true: <q>any cognition that is to hold <em>a priori</em> proclaims on its own that it wants to be regarded as absolutely necessary</q> (<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a>, Preface A) and <q>if we find a proposition such that in thinking it we think at the same time its necessity, then it is an <em>a priori</em> judgment</q><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a> , Introduction B). Hence, at least by his standards the questions concerning the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths, and our capacity for <em>a priori</em> judgements are equivalent. </span></span>
(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite></a>, introduction), <q>will make reason secure in its
rightful claims and will dismiss all baseless pretensions</q>(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>ibid.</cite></a>, preface A)
and put philosophy <q>on the secure path of a science</q>(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>ibid.</cite></a>, preface B).
While for his part, Bertrand Russell claimed that his new form of philosophy,
in which necessary truths were discovered through a process of  <q>logical
analysis, followed by logical synthesis</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203864777">russell1918-logicalAtomism</a></span></span>, <q>introduced the same kind of advance
into philosophy as Galileo introduced into physics, making it possible at last
to see what kinds of problems may be capable of solution, and what kinds must be
abandoned as beyond human powers</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Our_Knowledge_of_the_External_World_as_a_Field_for_Scientific_Method_in_Philosophy&oldid=11530349">russell1914-knowledgeOfExternalWorld</a></span></span>.  According to Russell this new method of
analysis would enable philosophers to <q>obtain results that do not merely

<p>
If it were just the members of these two movements who regarded explaining our
knowledge of necessary truths as the fundamental problem of philosophy, that
alone would be sufficient to warrant the claim that modern Anglo-European
philosophers generally (though of course not universally) regarded this problem
as <em>the</em> fundamental problem of philosophy. But in fact, this view was already
widespread amongst philosophers <em>prior</em> to these movements. Anxieties regarding
the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths predated the rise of
these movements, and it was because these movements appeared to offer solutions
that could allay those anxieties that they gained their extraordinary influence.
(Though of course, as successful salesmen are wont to, these movements' members
promoted the problem to which they thought they had a solution.)
</p>

<p>
Each of these two movements movement grew in popularity while its account of our
knowledge of necessary truths was regarded as plausible, and began to
disintegrate when its account was discredited. In neither case was
this disintegration instantaneous. For a time stylistic and social factors
continued to act as unifying forces; but without a unifying approach to
explaining the foundations of our knowledge of necessary truths, their members'
senses of what constituted good philosophical work drifted apart, and they
gradually fell into a range of factions with less and less in common.
</p>

<p>
Members of these two movements were some, but by no means all, of the
Anglo-European philosophers who believed that an account of the justification of
our knowledge of necessary truths would provide a touchstone for evaluating
philosophical claims and resolving philosophical
disputes; and that without such a touchstone two <q>awkward facts about
philosophy</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">This phrase is taken from Chris Daly (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/arisoc/aow020">2016</a>) though he does not share this pessimistic outlook</span></span> would continue to be true: <q>First, no philosophical problems have
been solved; second, philosophers cannot agree about anything beyond that</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/arisoc/aow020"><cite>ibid</cite>.</a></span></span>. It
is in this sense that modern Anglo-European philosophers generally came, at
least for a time, to regard providing an account of the justification of our
knowledge of necessary truths as <em>the</em> fundamental problem of philosophy.

<p>
The latest major development in the long collapse of the traditional
account of knowledge, has been a general loss of confidence in the
central project of Analytic philosophy - viz., to explain our knowledge of
necessary truths in terms of meanings and empirically acquired linguistic
competence, thereby reconciling our capacity to reason and discern the necessary
consequences of our beliefs with our scientific theories. In less than 50 years
the central tenets of Analytic philosophy (such as the doctrine that all
necessary truths are analytic, and our sensitivity to the
justification of necessary truths can be explained by our empirically justified
knowledge of our statements' meanings) went from being orthodoxies to
being viewed as <q>decidely antique</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Soames, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400825790"><cite>Philosophical Analysis in the 20th century</cite></a>, (2003)&zwj;</span></span> doctrines, held true by <q>very few
philosophers</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400825790">ibid.,</a></span></span>.
</p>

<p>
One of the causes of the rapid decline of Analytic philosophy, was the increased
scope offered for metaphysical speculation. Both Kantian and Analytic
philosophers had denounced the temptations of metaphysical speculation and its
appeal to <q>vanity and convenience</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans</a></span></span>. Of course, they drew the line between
productive philosophy and metaphysical speculation in different ways. According
to Kant we stray into metaphysical speculation when we claim to have knowledge
of things <q>as they are in themselves</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">ibid.,</a></span></span> rather than <q>only insofar as they appear
to us</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">ibid.,</a></span></span>. According to Analytic philosophers we stray into metaphysics when we
claim to have knowledge of necessary truths that are not true purely by virtue
of the linguistic proprieties of the language in which they are expressed. Both
these boundaries were, of course, disputed; as was the question of whether
philosophy (or science) could be done entirely without metaphysical speculation.
Regardless of the coherence of these limits, or how well Kantian and Analytic
philosophers abided by them, the speed and generality with which the central
tenets of Analytic philosophy fell into disrepute was certainly assisted by the
prospect of silencing critics of metaphysical speculation and once again openly
indulging in this traditional philosophical sport.
</p>

<p>
While the temptations of metaphysical speculation are among the <em>causes</em> of the
general loss of confidence in Analytic philosophy (in particular in the
claim that all necessary truths were analytic) the <em>reasons</em> for this loss of
confidence stemmed from two quite distinct problems raised by Analytic
philosophy's critics:
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-justification of analyses"><h4 id="justification of analyses" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-justification of analyses">justification of analyses</a></h4></div>
<p>
The first problem concerned the nature of the evidence for Analytic
philosophers analyses. In <a href="../zz.texts/quine1961-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf"><cite>Two Dogmas of Empiricism</cite></a> (1951), one of the most
influential philosophy papers of the second half of the 20th century, Quine
alleged that our epistemic access to the property of analyticity was every bit
as unclear as our epistemic access to necessity.  Although there was no
widespread agreement as to the structure, premises, or even conclusions of
Quine's arguments, Analytic philosophers' continuing inability to provide
a generally accepted account of how to determine whether a sentence of an
unfamiliar language is analytic was more than merely embarrassing. Difficulties
which, up until that point, had been thought to be merely technical<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">The exemplar being the failure of reduction in Carnap's <em>Aufbau der Welt</em>.</span></span>, came to
be suspected of being symptoms of a fundamental problem. In particular, it was
unclear whether Analytic philosophers' claims to reveal statements' hidden
logical/semantic/conceptual structure by analysis of their meanings, were any
more capable of being justified by empirical evidence than ascriptions of
necessity had been in the first place.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-a posteriori necessities"><h4 id="a posteriori necessities" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-a posteriori necessities">a posteriori necessities</a></h4></div>
<p>
The second problem concerned seemingly plausible examples of <em>a posteriori</em>
necessary truths presented by Saul Kripke (<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t40s0jk5g">1980</a>) and Hilary Putnam (????) such
as <q>Hesperus is Phosphorous</q> and <q>Water is H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O</q>.  Unlike the
truths of geometry, some courses of experience could confirm or
infirm these statements. However, according to their proponents, <em>if</em> these
statements are true then then are true necessarily. If empirical investigation
reveals that all water is composed of H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O then nothing that is not H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O
could possibly be water (this was sometimes expressed as the claim that there is
no possible world in which that other compound is water). Thus, if these
statements are indeed necessary truths, they are counterexamples to the claim
that all necessary truths are analytic. As one commentator put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
Kripke's famous conclusion that necessary truths can sometimes be known a
posteriori and that some contingent truths may be known a priori is
incompatible with treating statements of necessary truth as disguised
expressions of linguistic norms which, being products of stipulation, must
be known a priori. <br>
(Loomis, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20118231"><cite>Necessity, the A Priori, and the Standard Meter</cite>, 1999</a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence the explanation of our knowledge of ascriptions of necessity via
analyticity was at best incomplete, and our knowledge of at least some
necessary truths must be justified by other means.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives"><h2 id="re-confrontation with three basic alternatives" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives">re-confrontation with three basic alternatives</a></h2></div>
<p>
Almost from the start of Kantian philosophy's dominance, a variety of its
internal problems were recognised and widely discussed. While various attempts
to rectify those problems were ventured, none ever commanded the same general
acceptance as Kant's views at the height of their influence. There
were, of course, also external challenges to Kantian philosophy's dominance.
Darwin's successful explanation of the origin of species in entirely natural
terms inspired philosophers as disparate as Nietzsche and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer">Spencer</a> to offer
evolutionary accounts of human nature, accompanied by correspondingly dim
assessments of the scope and value of human reasoning. Under the banner of
scientific progress, populists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall">John Tyndall</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a> championed
versions of agnosticism in which they claimed, not perfectly consistently, to
reject all claims to knowledge of objects beyond those posited in our best
scientific theories and (perhaps) the experiences comprising our evidence for
them.
</p>

<p>
Despite these challenges, however, Kantianism continued to provide an effective
defence of traditional religion, morality and epistemology.  Due in no small
part to the implausibility of the accounts of reasoning offered by the
alternatives, Kantian approaches maintained a clear, though not unwavering,
dominance amongst professional Anglo-European philosophers for over a hundred
years. It was not until technical developments in formal logic improved Analytic
philosophy's prospects that Kantianism was finally displaced.  These technical
developments raised hopes that the statements of natural languages might be
translatable (at least in principle) into a notation in which all and only
necessary truths were expressed by the theorems of a formal logic. This hope
lent plausibility to one of Analytic philosophy's central claims: that the truth
of necessary truths was fixed by adherence to linguistic convention.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the rejection of Kantian in favour of Analytic approaches to explaining
our knowledge of necessary truths, the loss of confidence in the central
tenets of of Analytic philosophy was not occasioned by the discovery of new
approaches or techniques offering a better prospect of reconciling our
scientific theories with our understanding of our capacity to reason.
Where the final and most decisive loss of confidence in Kantian philosophy had
been due to its displacement by a newly invigorated alternative, the loss of
confidence in Analytic philosophy was (to the delight of the remaining Kantians)
due to its own internal antinomies. In the most influential philosophical paper
of the 20th century, Quine attacked the analytic-synthetic distinction on the
grounds that it was <q>an unempirical dogma of empiricists</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">zz.texts/quine1953-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf</span></span>.
According to Quine, in taking the distinction between analytic and non-analytic
statements seriously, Analytic philosophers were failing to live up to the
epistemological standards that had driven them to claim that all necessary
truths were analytic in the first place.
</p>

<p>
The collapse of confidence in Analytic philosophy is a distinguishable disaster
within the overall collapse of traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning.
After demolishing the known alternatives, the last and most promising approach
to reconciling our capacity for knowledge of necessary truths with our
scientific theories collapsed under its own weight, leaving no clear alternative
to take its place. One effect of this collapse was that many academic
philosophers simply moved on to other topics. Beating one's head against a
seemingly intractable problem in which all the most plausible leads had been
tried and found wanting was not merely frustrating. In a publish or perish
academic environment it was prudent to move onto other topics where it was
easier to appear to make progress and whose relevance to non-philosophers was
more obvious. Furthermore, since the limits that Kantian and Analytic philosophers
had sought to place upon philosophical practice had been discredited, the range
of methods philosophers could employ<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">The pre-eminent example being the methods of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_philosophy">experimental philosophy</a>.</span></span> and topics they could investigate without
their peers dismissing their work as as unphilosophical was wider than ever<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or at least the social sanctions against transgressing those bounds were less effective</span></span>.
</p>

<p>
Among those philosophers who continued to try to reconcile our theories of the
world with our understanding of our capacity to reason, a natural reaction to
reaching this apparent dead end was to reconsider the path that had led up to
it. Without a new and more promising approach into which to direct their
efforts, these philosophers were thrown back into reconsidering the fundamental
alternatives that had been apparent from the outset. Stripped of all the
refinements, subtleties and techniques that had been developed in the roughly
three hundred years since the conflict had come to philosophers' attention,
these three fundamental alternatives are: naturalism is false, naturalism is
true and we have knowledge of necessary truths, or we do not have knowledge
of necessary truths and the traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning are
false.
</p>

<p>
Let us consider each of these alternatives, and some of the various ways
philosophers pursued them, in turn:
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-first alternative: naturalism is false"><h3 id="first alternative: naturalism is false" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-first alternative: naturalism is false">first alternative: naturalism is false</a></h3></div>
<p>
If naturalism is false then the laws and principles governing the rest of the
natural world (and fallibly and incompletely described in our empirically
justified scientific theories) are not the only laws governing our actions and
the formation of our beliefs.  The naturalistic constraints that Kantian and
Analytic philosophers aspired to abide by are simply misplaced.  There are
fundamental aspects of the world that have been omitted from scientific
descriptions of the world, and which may be undiscoverable by scientific
methods.
</p>

<p>
That we cannot discover a way in which a system constructed purely from
components obeying laws discoverable by scientific investigation could reason in
the way we do (or even behave in a way consonant with being reasoning agents) is
not a problem because we are not systems solely obeying scientific laws and our
observable behaviour does not <q>conform necessarily to natural law</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans</a></span></span>. If this
alternative is correct then reason may be an extra-empirical source of
substantive knowledge about the necessary structure of the world (much as the
ancient Greeks had thought the study of geometry to be) and an influence on our
actions that is altogether omitted from scientific descriptions of the world.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious (though not the most popular) example of re-engagement with
this alternative amongst philosophers at the end of the 20th century was a
marked resurgence of interest in Aristotelian metaphysics and epistemology
(particularly in American universities). But an open return to Aristotelian
philosophy was not the only form of re-engagement with this alternative.
</p>

<p>
Attempts at rehabilitating rationalism centered on new versions of modal realism
were even more popular. The best known of these were developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)#Realism_about_possible_worlds">David Lewis</a>
and <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/fine-k/">Kit Fine</a><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Though Saul Kripke may have been more influential in reviving the investigation of modal logic, his status as a modal realist is less clear-cut.</span></span>. According to their accounts, the truth-makers of modal truths are
either other possible worlds just as real as the actual world we inhabit, or at
at least aspects of the actual world which exist independently of our attitudes
towards them. There was, however, no widely accepted account of our epistemic
access to these truths. Our knowledge of them was variously attributed to a raw
intuitive ability to gain insight into <q>the necessary character of reality</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">BonJour, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511625176"><cite>In Defense of Pure Reason: A Rationalist Account of A Priori Justification</cite>, 1997</a></span></span>,
an ability to perceive modal relationships akin to either our perception of
physical objects<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Bealer, <a href="../zz.texts/collection2002-conceivabilityPossibility.pdf">collection2002-conceivabilityPossibility</a></span></span> or our introspective awareness of our own thoughts, a
sensitivity to the unity and economy of our overall theories<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net//ark:/13960/t16n0s46p">lewis1986-pluralityOfWorlds</a></span></span> or even to
<q>philosophical analysis</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t40s0jk5g">kripke1980-namingAndNecessity</a></span></span> (albeit in a sense richer than had been countenanced
by proponents of Analytic philosophy in its heyday).  In any case, our capacity
to reason was once again supposed to give us knowledge of substantive features
of the world which, although completely omitted from our scientific theories,
nonetheless affect (or are at least correlated with) the formation of beliefs
which go on to affect our actions.
</p>

<p>
In recent times rigorous measures of philosophers' professional opinions have
begun to become available. The first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-013-0259-7">PhilPapers survey</a>
being conducted in 2009 and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/phimp.2109">the second</a> in 2020. Both were well after
the major loss of confidence in Analytic philosophy's central tenets. By 2006
philosophers were already publishing papers such as
<em>Passing by the Naturalistic Turn</em> in which the very idea that scientific
theories could clarify epistemological issues was denounced as a cul-de-sac.
According to its author, Naturalism <em>had</em> been popular, at least in America:
</p>
<blockquote>
Naturalism, it has been said, is the distinctive development in philosophy
over the last thirty years. There has been a naturalistic turn away from the
<em>a priori</em> methods of traditional philosophy to a conception of philosophy as
continuous with natural science. The doctrine has been extensively discussed
and has won considerable following in the USA.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S003181910631604X"><cite>Passing by the Naturalistic Turn: On Quine's Cul-de-Sac</cite></a>, 2006)
But thus turn was a misstep, a cul-de-sac, from which we were happily
retreating, and which played no part in philosophical progress:
</p>
<blockquote>
[Scientific theories] could shed no light on the nature of knowledge, its
possible extent, its categorially distinct kinds, its relation to belief and
justification, and its forms of certainty. Nor is the investigation of the
relationship between irradiations and cognitive utterances a subject for
philosophers. For philosophy is neither continuous with existing science,
nor continuous with an imaginary future science.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S003181910631604X"><cite>ibid.</cite></a>)
<p class="smallnote">The shift from taking <em>naturalism</em> to be the doctrine that the processes
which give rise to our actions and the formation of our beliefs are composed of
objects obeying the same rules as the rest of the natural world, to the doctrine
that philosophy is <q>continuous</q> with science is itself an aspect of the
collapse of analytic philosophy, being supposed to be further aspect of Quine's
rejection of the distinction between necessary and contingent truths. However,
where Quine took it as showing that modal claims should be rejected altogether,
those who inherited the doctrine of <q>continuity</q> from him tended to take it
as showing that metaphysical speculation was not sharply distinguishable from
(and hence as respectable as) scientific theorising.</p>
</p>

<p>
Still, even between the two PhilPapers surveys, the loss of confidence in
naturalism was measurable. In response to the question <q>Metaphilosophy:
naturalism or non-naturalism?</q> the percentage of respondents who indicated
that they <q>accept or lean towards</q> naturalism dropped from 50% to
43%<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">PhilPaper's authors suggest using their measure of <q>swing</q>, which they define in their report.  The swing against accepting or leaning towards naturalism was 1.71.</span></span>.  There was not, however, a matching gain in respondents who accepted or
leant towards non-naturalism. Instead the response to that question which gained
the most between the two surveys was <q>Insufficiently familiar with the
issue</q> (from 7% to 12%). Neither was there a significant increase in the
percentage of respondents who accepted or leant towards rationalism (only from
28% to 29%).  Instead the question <q>Knowledge: empiricism or rationalism?</q>
saw an across the board increase in all the variously agnostic responses: <q>The
question is too unclear to answer</q>, <q>There is no fact of the matter</q>
<q>Insufficiently familiar with the issue</q> and <q>Agnostic/undecided</q>.
Suggesting that philosophers were not shifting from naturalism to
non-naturalism, so much abandoning or avoiding the question and engaging with
other topics where they felt they could make more progress.
</p>

<p>
Although influential rationalists such as George Bealer declared the start
of the 21st century to be a <q>rationalist rennaissance</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Bealer, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198250890.001.0001"><cite>Modal Epistemology and the Rationalist Renaissance</cite></a>, 2002</span></span>, the rejection of
naturalism was not always accompanied by renewed confidence in rationalism. 
Instead, naturalism's rejection was often combined with a vague feeling that the
grand projects of Anglo-European philosophy had come to naught, or, perhaps had
never been so grand to begin with. If the assumptions those projects had
relied upon had been right, then the Kantian or Analytic movements would have
provided the key standard by which to distinguish good from bad reasoning, but
they were not right. Those philosophical movements might not only have been 
mistaken about the basis of our justification for believing statements to be
necessarily true. They may also have been mistaken about the importance of
providing an account of that justification at all. Perhaps, in the end, instead
of being a fundamental universal issue of epistemology, the issue of the
justification of our knowledge of necessary truths (and perhaps the
division of knowledge into <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em>, and truths into
necessary and contingent) was merely a parochial concern of a
limited and eventually self-defeating tradition.
</p>

<p>
In any case, Kantian and Analytic philosophers' attempts to delineate the range
of questions that could be answered by means of pure reason were generally
regarded as having been shown to be self-defeating. Their failure to live up to
their own standards was widely taken as showing that their standards were
incoherent, or at least unachievable; and the limits they had sought to impose
on philosophical practice could once again be flouted unashamedly. Whether or
not it was explicitly acknowledged as such, commitment to an unnatural capacity
to discern necessary truths was no longer taken as disqualifying philosophical
positions from further consideration.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths"><h3 id="second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths">second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths</a></h3></div>
<p>
If naturalism is true and we have knowledge of necessary truths, then creatures
as successful as humans are in believing necessary truths just when they are
justified in doing so can be made from purely natural materials (or at least
without the changes in the natural materials from which their bodies are made
diverging from what they would be if they were made from purely natural
materials).  As we have seen, finding how this might be so has been a central
preoccupation of the dominant movements of modern Anglo-European philosophy.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps analytic philosophy true after all"><h5 id="perhaps analytic philosophy true after all" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps analytic philosophy true after all">perhaps analytic philosophy true after all</a></h5></div>
<p>
One way in which this alternative could turn out to be true is if some version
of Analytic philosophy is correct. If all necessary truths are analytic and
analyticity in any given language is a complex but natural property of sentences
that one learns to distinguish as part of learning that language (much as
validity in a given logical notation is a complex but natural property of some
well-formed formulae of first-order logic that one may learn to distinguish in
undergraduate logic classes); then appeals to analyticity might (in combination
with accounts of what languages are and how we learn them) explain how purely
natural causal systems could be capable of distinguishing necessary truths. Such
appeals might also explain how our belief in the necessity of such truths is
justified. For analytic sentences must be held true on pain of linguistic
incompetence.  If being justified in believing a statement is a matter of it
being correct or proper to hold that statement to be true, and it is always
proper to do what is required<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">A principle as certain as ought implies can.</span></span>, then one is always justified in holding true
those statements one is required to hold true.  If anything roughly along these
lines is correct then, in something like the way that our experiences both
<em>justify</em> our belief in contingent truths and are <em>causally connected</em> with the
formation of those beliefs, so too analyticity both <em>justifies</em> our beliefs in
necessary truths and is <em>causally connected</em> (perhaps very indirectly) with the
formation of those beliefs.
</p>

<p>
Although the collapse of confidence in Analytic accounts of our knowledge of
necessary truths was precisely a loss of confidence in these sorts of accounts,
their tremendous popularity before this collapse ensured that they retained
many defenders.  The most straightforward manifestation of the continued
defence of Analytic accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths
was a steady stream of journal articles claiming to refute Quine's
allegation that there is no principled way of distinguishing analytic truths.
Some of these putative refutations involved proposing criteria for
distinguishing analytic truths that were supposed to meet Quine's standards
(e.g. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2182828">Grice, 1956</a>, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2219445">Priest, 1979</a>, <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t0gv3gf5x">Putnam, 1983</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2953775">Katz, 1997</a>); others argued
that Quine's standards were too strict (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2266637">Kemeny, 1952</a>); admitted too narrow a
range of evidence (<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2m2f4p1c92">Fodor and Lepore, 1992</a>); failed to take normative aspects of
language use into account (<a href="10.1080/0967255032000108011">Fennell, 2003</a>) or were unreasonable in demanding that
<q>analytic</q> be reducible to terms of observable verbal behaviour
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8349.00071">Sober, 2000</a>) or defined in extensional terms (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1163/18756735-90000813">Nimtz, 2003</a>).  As their
continued production suggests, none of these refutations was widely accepted.
Their net effect was not a regaining of old confidence, but a growing sense of
confused exhaustion. What had once been thought so clear that it might serve as
the touchstone of the value of all necessary judgements was now a mystery.
</p>

<p>
There wasn't even general agreement at to what Quine's attack on analytic truth
had been.  Some claimed that the Quine's only reason for supposing that
analytic statements could not be distinguished was that past attempts had
failed (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2564611">Sher, 1999</a><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><q>Quine's 'jump' from the claim that past attempts to establish the distinction faces serious difficulties to the claim that the distinction is (in principle) an untenable dogma is obviously not a step in deductive reasoning</q></span></span>&zwj;), others that his only good argument had been the
<q>historical argument</q> that some truths that had been traditionally held to
be known <em>a priori</em> (most notably the principles of Euclidean geometry) had
turned out to be false (<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t0gv3gf5x">Putnam, 1983</a>).  Still others held that there was a
principled reason for supposing that the distinction cold not be drawn, but
that it depended upon the doctrine of the indeterminacy of translation which
itself entailed an <q>unpalatable skepticism about meaning</q> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2216275">Boghossian, 1996</a>).
</p>

<p>
Despite the lack of any consensus concerning either the structure or value of
Quine's arguments, Analytic accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths
suffered an seemingly terminal loss of popularity: <q>philosophers en masse &hellip;
either joined Quine in repudiating the "analytic/synthetic" distinction or
remained (however mutinously) silent and made no claims of analyticity</q> but
without accepting Quine's <q>radical &hellip;  views on linguistic meaning generally</q>
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-3346-3_5">Lycan, 1991</a>).  Though some eminent philosophers continued to propose accounts
of analyticity<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brandom">Robert Brandom</a> leaps to mind.</span></span> and the value of Quine's criticisms is still debated, the
simple fact remains that after a little over a century of trying no-one has yet
managed to propose a standard of analyticity that has been widely found to be
acceptable.

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps some other reconciliation"><h5 id="perhaps some other reconciliation" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps some other reconciliation">perhaps some other reconciliation</a></h5></div>
<p>
But a vindication of some version of Analytic philosophy is not the only way in
which this second alternative might turn out to be true. If there were some
other natural process, one which did not especially involve linguistic
proprieties, that could account for our capacity to distinguish necessary truths
then naturalism and our possession of knowledge of such truths might be
reconciled in some way that Analytic philosophers had not envisaged.
</p>

<p>
The apparent discovery of necessary truths in which belief was justified
<em>a posteriori</em><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">i.e. with the aid of experience</span></span> seemed to open up just this possibility. If we had
knowledge of <em>a posteriori</em> necessities then there must be some way in
which knowledge of substantive necessary truths, truths which might be
questioned or rejected by competent language users (and hence were not
analytic) might be justified by observation. Perhaps the doctrine, commonly
held by both Kantian and Analytic philosophers, that belief in necessary truths
can only be justified by pure reason, was false. Hopes were raised that
rejecting this restriction might open up an approach to reconciling naturalism
with our possession of knowledge of necessary truths that Analytic and Kantian
philosophers had mistakenly excluded. Such hopes, however, did not survive
closer inspection of these <em>a posteriori</em> necessities.
</p>

<p>
The most widely accepted examples of <em>a posteriori</em> necessities presented by
Kripke (<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t40s0jk5g">1980</a>) were all identity statements, and each was deduced via an
instance of the following argument schema:
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td>
(P1)
</td>
<td>
∀x,y (x=y &sup; ☐ x=y)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
(P2)
</td>
<td>
a=b
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
(C)
</td>
<td>
☐ a=b
</td>
</tr>
</table>
The premise (P1), which warrants the inference from empirically confirmed
identity statements to claims that such identities obtain necessarily, was
itself supposed to be necessarily true and known <em>a priori</em>. (P2) was a
contingent identity statement  in which belief was justified, at least in part,
by experience and observation (e.g. <q>Winona Ryder is Winona Horowitz</q>). The
conclusion derived from these two premises was thus both a true ascription of
necessity and justified, in part, by observation.
</p>

<p>
Kripke offered at least two justifications for (P1). The first was that (P1)
could be deduced from the claim that all objects are necessarily self-identical
(<q>∀x ☐(x=x)</q>) and the principle of the indiscernability of identicals
(<q>∀x,y(x=y &sup;. F(x) &sup; F(y</span></span></q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">In the relevant instance of this schema the open formula in place of <q>F(&hellip;)</q> is: <q>☐( &hellip; = x)</q></span></span>&zwj;).
The second was that (P1) could have no counter examples for:
</p>
<blockquote>
What pairs could be counterexamples?  Not pairs of distinct objects,
for then the antecedent is false; nor any pair of an object and itself, for
then the consequent is true.<br>
(Kripke, <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t40s0jk5g"><cite>Naming and Necessity</cite></a>, 1980)
</blockquote>
<p>
While these justifications swayed many, they were not an explanation of our
capacity to distinguish necessary truths (nor intended as such). Kripke took the
principles from which (P1) could be derived to be such obvious first-principles
that he did not attempt to present any justification for them:
</p>
<blockquote>
Already when I worked on modal logic it had seemed to me, as Wiggins has
said, that the Leibnitzian principle of the indiscernibility of identicals
was as self evident as the law of contradiction. That some philosophers
could have doubted it always seemed to me bizarre.<br>
(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t40s0jk5g"><cite>ibid.</cite></a>, 1980)
</blockquote>
<p>
The question of how a purely natural system might discern such <q>self evident</q>
truths was simply not addressed.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps some other reconciliation-putnam necessities"><h6 id="putnam necessities" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps some other reconciliation-putnam necessities">putnam necessities</a></h6></div>
<p>
Like Kripke's <em>a posteriori</em> necessities, the <em>a posteriori</em> necessities
Putnam presented were inferred from a combination of necessary truths known
<em>a priori</em> and contingent truths discovered by empirical investigation. The
most widely repeated of Putnam's <em>a posteriori</em> necessities was <q>Water is
H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O</q>. This supposed necessity was derived from the <em>a posteriori</em>
scientific discovery that water <q>around here</q> is more or less dilute
mixtures of various chemicals with H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O; and the <em>a priori</em>
necessary principle that:
</p>
<blockquote>
"water" is stuff that bears a certain similarity relation to the water
around here. Water at another time or in another place or even in another
possible world has to bear the relation same<sub><small>L</small></sub><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">i.e. same_liquid</span></span> to
our "water" in order to be water.<br>
(Putnam, <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11299/185225">_The meaning of <q>meaning</q>_</a>, 1975)
</blockquote>
<p>
This principle, in turn,  was itself justified by <em>analysis</em> of the term
<q>water</q>.  Putnam claimed, quite convincingly, that <q>water</q> was a
natural kind term, and <q>the predominant sense of natural kind words</q> was
one in which they were true of <q>whatever things share the nature that things
satisfying the description [potable, thirst quenching, transparent etc.,]
normally possess</q>. Sharing a nature was a matter of having the same 
<q>hidden structure</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><q>To sum up: if there is a hidden structure, then generally it determines what it is to be a member of the natural kind, not only in the actual world, but in all possible worlds.</q> (<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11299/185225">_ibid.,</a>) </span></span>, and in the case of liquids such as water
this hidden structure was <em>chemical</em> structure.  In other words, the statement
<q>All water bears the relationship same<sub><small>L</small></sub> to the water around here.</q> was
<em>analytic</em> - true by virtue of the meanings of the terms it contains. (Most
saliently, though of course not solely, the meaning of the term <q>water</q>.)
Anyone using the term <q>water</q> (in its <q>predominant sense</q>)
must hold  <q> &hellip; is water</q> to be true of any substance that of which they have
a justified belief that it is the same kind of liquid as <q>the water around
here</q> on pain of linguistic impropriety.

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps some other reconciliation-both deduced from necessarily true principles known _a priori_"><h6 id="both deduced from necessarily true principles known _a priori_" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-perhaps some other reconciliation-both deduced from necessarily true principles known _a priori_">both deduced from necessarily true principles known <em>a priori</em></a></h6></div>
<p>
Both sorts of <em>a posteriori</em> necessary truths are deduced from necessarily true
principles known <em>a priori</em>. Kripke's from the principle that all objects are
necessarily identical to themselves. Putnam's from the principle that all
water necessarily bears the relationship same<sub><small>L</small></sub> to water around here. Kripke,
for his part, supposed the former to be a fundamental aspect of the nature of
reality that our power of reasoning gave us the capacity to recognise as true
merely by contemplating it (though many analytic philosophers were happy to
recognise this principle of self-identity as analytic). Putnam held the
latter principle to be an analytic truth, one competent speakers could tell was
true by virtue of their capacity to tell true semantic analyses from false.
</p>

<p>
Neither Kripke's nor Putnam's <em>a posteriori</em> necessities provided the slightest
hint as to how observation might justify believing truths to be necessary
without reliance upon another necessary truth in which belief was justified
<em>a priori</em>. Nor did they provide any account of how we could distinguish valid
arguments (such as those by which their <em>a posteriori</em> necessities were deduced)
from invalid ones.  Nor did they cast any new light on the nature of our
justification for <em>a priori</em> necessary truths. They provided no hint of how to
reconcile naturalism with our capacity to gain knowledge of necessary truths (of
any kind); and their chief proponents never suggested that they did.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, the widespread agreement that these truths were <em>a posteriori</em>
necessities had two major effects. They were, predictably, used to license
rationalism and metaphysical speculation (see [!citations required!]).
But even among those who did not pursue rationalist accounts of our knowledge of
necessary truths they had the effect of making the crisis created by the
ongoing inability to provide a satisfactory account of analyticity seem less
pressing.  Putnam's and Kripke's <em>a posteriori</em> necessities were widely regarded
as decisive counter examples to the central Analytic claim that all necessary
truths were analytic. It was easy to feel that if some necessary truths were not
analytic then there must be some other way in which our knowledge of necessary
truths could be justified.  This feeling could persist, wherever it wasn't
considered directly, even though these <em>a posteriori</em> necessities were not
accompanied by any new suggestions as to the justification of our knowledge of
the <em>a priori</em> necessities from which they were deduced.
</p>

<p>
Despite superficial appearances to the contrary, <em>a posteriori</em> necessities
opened up no new alternative accounts of the justification of belief in
necessary truths.  Indeed our knowledge of these <em>a posteriori</em> necessities is
itself transparently dependent upon our knowledge of <em>a priori</em> necessary
truths. For the same reason they posed no new problem for epistemology. Any
account which explained both the <em>a posteriori</em> justification of contingent
truths, and the <em>a priori</em> justification of necessary truths (together with an
account of our ability to discern valid arguments) would also explain our
justification for believing these <em>a posteriori</em> truths. Despite this they were
used to justify the suggestion that we must have some other form of epistemic
access to necessary truths that was not dependent upon analyticity (see
[!citations required!] and allowed the problem of explaining the <em>a priori</em>
justification of our knowledge of necessary truths to be viewed as just one more
philosophical problem among many[!citations desired!].
</p>

<p>
Surviving members of the Analytic old guard, such as A.J. Ayer, who remained
committed to the principle that all necessary truths are analytic were dismissed
as <q>old-fashioned</q> and <q>confused</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="../zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/williamson2014-howDidWeGetHereFromThereTheTransformationOfAnalyticPhilosophy.pdf">zz.referenceOnly/williamson2014-howDidWeGetHereFromThereTheTransformationOfAnalyticPhilosophy</a></span></span>.  The dispute between Kantians and
Analytic philosophers as to how our knowledge of necessary truths was justified
could be put aside as <q>the usual empiricism/Kantianism oscillation</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Putnam, <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11299/185225">1975</a>)&zwj;</span></span>; an old
dispute leading nowhere in which both sides were based upon the pre-supposition
of Hume's false dichotomy between <q>relations of ideas</q> (which were
necessary and known <em>a priori</em>) and <q>matters of fact</q> (contingent and known
<em>a posteriori</em>). Many academic philosophers, worn out by the
repeated failure of attempts to explain our knowledge of necessary truths,
having no promising leads in the wake of the collapse of Analytic accounts, and
under unrelenting pressure to publish, simply embraced the opportunity to
downgrade the importance of explaining our knowledge of necessary truths and
changed topic.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-second alternative: summary"><h4 id="second alternative: summary" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-second alternative: reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessary truths-second alternative: summary">second alternative: summary</a></h4></div>
<p>
At the beginning of the 21st century the prospect of reconciling naturalism with
our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings capable of gaining knowledge
of necessary truths was as remote as it had ever been. Attempts to develop
semantic theories capable of distinguishing correct from incorrect
philosophical/conceptual/logical/linguistic analyses had failed repeatedly.
Although there was little agreement as to the substance of Quine's attacks on
the notion of analyticity, there was a growing sense that these failures were
due to fundamental misconceptions concerning language and linguistic
representation.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, although the discovery of <em>a posteriori</em> necessary truths was
widely taken as refuting the claim that all necessary truths are analytic, they
did not alter the fundamental situation. Analytic philosophers had appealed to
analyticity to explain our capacity to distinguish necessary truths because
they had supposed that all and only necessary truths were analytic and
analyticity was a natural property<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Though an admittedly complex. Perhaps akin to the property of being a valid schema of first order logic.</span></span> that could causally affect the formation of
our beliefs.  If appeals to analyticity can reconcile naturalism with our
possession of knowledge of <em>a priori</em> necessary truths; then, provided that all
<em>a posteriori</em> necessary truths can be deduced by valid arguments from a
combination of <em>a priori</em> necessary truths and <em>a posteriori</em> contingent
truths<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">as can all the examples presented by Putnam and Kripke</span></span> and each valid argument has a matching analytic conditional, appeals to
analyticity can also reconcile naturalism with our possession of knowledge of
<em>a posteriori</em> necessary truths. (Or at least our knowledge of necessary truths
may be no more difficult to reconcile with naturalism than our knowledge of
<em>a posteriori</em> contingent truths.)
</p>

<p>
Despite being widely used to license rationalism and downgrade the significance
of the crisis created by the loss of confidence in Analytic accounts of our
knowledge of necessary truths[!citations required!], these <em>a posteriori</em>
necessities provided neither grounds for doubting that appeals to analyticity
could explain our knowledge of necessary truths in naturalistic terms, nor
for believing that there was some other way in which our knowledge of
necessary truths could be justified.
</p>

<p>
Though 
</p>


<p>
Still hope for this alternative was not entirely extinguished. 
As with the first alternative, pursuit of this second
alternative appeared to have lead philosophers into an impassable morass.
</p>

<p>
Still, the obscurity of Quine's arguments,
combined with
optimism and sheer inertia, meant that this alternative
</p>

<p>
and a caused this alternative to remain popular amongst the
inheritors of the Analytic tradition, but the net effect of a hundred years of
philosophy had been to recreate the mazed confusion concerning the
basis of our knowledge of necessary truths that the early titans of Analytic
philosophy had confidently claimed to be on the brink of resolving.
</p>

<p>
While hope was not extinguished one might hope that some as yet undreamt of
reconciliation might yet be found, the only consensus after somewhat over 300 hundred
years of trying was that nothing that had been tried so far had worked
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-third alternative: reject the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning"><h3 id="third alternative: reject the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-third alternative: reject the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning">third alternative: reject the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning</a></h3></div>

<p>
The third alternative is to reject the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning. Reject the claim that our capacity to reason involves the ability to
distinguish between necessary and contingent truths and abandon Aristotle's
claim that the best form of knowledge involves being aware <q>that it is not
possible for [the thing known] to be otherwise</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8bh0gh94"><cite>Posterior Analytics</cite>, Book I, §2</a></span></span>.
Reject the distinction
between necessary and contingent truths itself, and in its place offer an
alternative explanation of what it is about supposedly necessary truths that
allows us to (more or less reliably) distinguish them.
</p>

<p>
This third alternative is neither novel nor popular. Its eminent proponents
include both Mill and, somewhat inconstantly, Hume<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Both of whose views foundered, in large part, because of the implausibly impoverished accounts of reasoning they offered.</span></span>. Since the loss of
confidence in Analytic accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths, however,
this alternative's only influential advocate has been Quine.  While he was very
influential indeed, and his modal scepticism well known, his attack on
modality was far less widely accepted than his rejection of analyticity.
Regarded more widely as a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>  of Quine's views than as a
plausible claim, complete modal scepticism, the claim that we have no knowledge
of necessary truths, has had no other influential advocates at all.

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-first two alternatives entail a pessimistic assessment of modern philosophy"><h3 id="first two alternatives entail a pessimistic assessment of modern philosophy" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-re-confrontation with three basic alternatives-first two alternatives entail a pessimistic assessment of modern philosophy">first two alternatives entail a pessimistic assessment of modern philosophy</a></h3></div>

<p>
Each of these alternatives, except for 
</p>

<p>
requires
</p>


<p>
Unless Analytic philosophy correct both of the first two alternatives
</p>


<p>
Re-confrontation with these three alternatives may easily be taken as a sign of
modern philosophy's lack of progress. Despite going through a periods of
consensus in which the conflict between our scientific theories and our capacity
to distinguish necessary truths was generally thought to be either solved or
about to be solved, the only opinion on this topic generally shared amongst
philosophers at the start of the 21st century was that none of the solutions
attempted thus far had been successful.
After four hundred years of trying
philosophers were as far from general agreement as to which one of these basic
alternatives was correct as they ever had been.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, if almost any of these alternatives is correct, the situation is worse
than a mere lack of progress. The dominant movements of modern Anglo-European
philosophy will have been devoted to pursuing dead-ends. Dead-ends from which
philosophers must extricate themselves by returning to some earlier view
before progress can be made.
</p>

<p>
If the first alternative is correct, and naturalism is false, then the problem
at the centre of Anglo-European philosophy's dominant movements for the last
four hundred years has been a delusion.  Modern philosophers' attempts to
explain how we can be both reasoning beings and creatures whose observable
actions <q>have to be explicable according to natural laws</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans</a></span></span>
will turn out to have been as quixotic as alchemists' attempts to explain how to
transmute lead into gold. Dazzled by scientific successes many modern
philosophers will have been drawn into falsely believing that explanations of
our capacity to reason must fit within scientific constraints; and it is only
once they free themselves from such <q>scientism</q> that genuine progress in
understanding the human capacity to reason will be made.
</p>

<p>
If, the second alternative is correct then the length of time that the
dominant movements of modern Anglo-European philosophy have been bent upon
pursuing dead-ends may be less.  If Analytic philosophers were mistaken in
insisting that the only way in which naturalism could be reconciled with our
capacity to distinguish necessary truths was if all necessary truths were
analytic, then it is only for the last hundred years or so that the dominant
movement of Anglo-European philosophy has been barking up the wrong tree.
</p>

<p>
The alternative that is compatible with the most optimistic assessment of modern
philosophy's progress on this central issue, is of course Analytic philosophers
turning out to be right. If a naturalistic account of our capacity to
distinguish analytic truths could be given, and all and only such truths were
necessary analytic truths could be distinguished, 
If a naturalistic account of our capacity to
distinguish 
</p>

<p>
justification of necessary truths could be provided on roughly Analytic lines.
</p>

<p>
And such analyticity also guaranteed
</p>

<p>
most optimistic assessment of modern philosophy's progress is compatible 
will of course be if 
Analytic
philosophers were right all along, all necessary truths are analytic, and
whatever it is we learn in the natural process of learning a language justifies
our belief that those truths are necessary
</p>

<p>
it would only be some critics of Analytic
philosophy who had been mistaken and it would only be in temporarily doubting
that all necessary truths were analytic, or that analytic truths could be
distinguished on principled empirical grounds, that Anglo-European philosophy
had gone into a <q>cul-de-sac</q> and then only for the last few decades.
</p>


<p>
At first glance, the third alternative may appear to require as negative

There are only two less dismal . If the second al

necessary truths was a reversion to the ancient order.  Explaining our knowledge
of necessary truths, whether of mathematics, physics or biology, was the central
goal of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning. Not because the
ancient proponents of the traditional view thought the empirical justification
of knowledge of contingent truths was straightforward, but because they held
certain knowledge of necessary truths to be the only sort of knowledge worth
considering.

It is tempting, at this point, to suggest that the principles of reasoning are
bedrock. That no further justification is required. But what we are seeking is
not justification. No more than an account of the physical processes of the eye
increase confidence in our vision.  But rather we want an account of how
physical creatures such as ourselves can be sensitive to such justifications.
