<p>
Roughly four hundred years have passed since European philosophers had an
account of reasoning that was compatible with their understanding of the world
around them. Just over two generations have passed since the collapse of the
last great philosophical research program devoted to producing an account of
reasoning compatible with our most plausible scientific theories. Sheer time,
and repeated failure, have rendered acceptable what was once felt to
absolutely intolerable. In order to rouse ourselves from the numbing effects of
failure and familiarity, let us cast our minds back to rosier days when our
theories of the world and our theories of our capacity to reason were
compatible.
</p>

<p>
Long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us to truth. Our minds
contained concepts, and these concepts were the same as, or at least very
similar to, the properties of the objects around us. (Perhaps in something like
the way that an object and its impression in a clay tablet are similar.) Maybe
these concepts were imprinted in our minds through our senses, or maybe they
were perfect forms of which physical properties were imperfect copies. But in
either case there was a consonance between our concepts and the properties of
the objects around us. The sensation felt when touching a flame was thought to
be identical to the heat which causes the flame to burn. The weight felt when
lifting a stone identical to the weight in the stone which caused it to resist
being pushed; and the color seen when looking at a white patch of snow identical
to the whiteness of the snow. Because of these direct encounters with objects'
properties we could intuit the fundamental necessary principles governing those
properties. 
</p>

<p>
A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the Christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the material world around us; but even limited intellects
such as ours could determine which combinations of properties were possible or
impossible by examining which combinations of concepts we could conceive of
<q>clearly and distinctly</q> (in Descartes' famous phrase). Combinations of
properties that could not be conceived despite our familiarity with them, such
as would be realised by round squares, or triangles whose internal angles did
not sum to two right angles, were impossible.
</p>

<p>
The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume) was geometry.
Geometry taken, not as we now understand it, an investigation into various
non-physical mathematical idealisations, but as the ancients understood it, an
investigation into the spatial properties of physical objects. Geometry was the
exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was taken to show that
reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles imprinted in us by
experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and observation, could produce
substantial knowledge of the necessary structure of the world.  There were, of
course, famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the fallibility of
the senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that our
justifications for beliefs about the external world did not reach the standard
set by geometry. Rather than challenging the classical theory of knowledge,
ancient skeptics simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.
</p>

<p>
In the European intellectual tradition, philosophers began to note the cracks
heralding the long, gradual, collapse of this account of reason and
knowledge around the beginning of the 17th century. It is, of course, impossible
to put a precise date upon when the collapse began and, as yet, it is not
complete. At first, awareness of the problems in the traditional account spread
piecemeal, and when they were noted they did not immediately give rise to
despair, but rather to various attempts to repair or resolve them. The
death-knell of the ancient account of reasoning might reasonably be said to have
been struck in 1919, when decisive empirical evidence was gathered confirming
Einstein's theory that physical space was not Euclidean. But although it is now
generally accepted that the geometry of physical space is neither Euclidean, nor
capable of being known <em>a priori</em>, the traditional account of reasoning continues
to have devoted adherents (e.g. <a href="../zz.texts/chisholm1987-truths_of_reason">Chisholm, 1987</a>).
????
Even to the current day, and among those who accept that many of traditional
account's claims are unequivocally false, the most obdurate elements of this
account continue to restrict the range of accounts of our capacity to reason
that are thought to be worth considering. ????Continues to influence our
accounts of our capacity to reason from beyond the grave.????
</p>

<p>
The key cause of this collapse, was the undeniable increase in scientific
knowledge, which posed two distinct and fundamental problems for the traditional
accounts of knowledge and reasoning.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories"><h2 id="first problem: the justification of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first problem: the justification of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
While the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor
known with the same certainty as principles of geometry, it was not preposterous
to cast them as being like geometrical principles in being necessarily true
and known with greater certainty than the observable consequences derived
from them. Like geometrical principles, physical principles could also be held
to be made true by the essential natures of the objects and properties they
concerned. On this view, the Aristotelian principle that heat rises, for
instance, is not an empirical generalisation, but an essential aspect of the
nature of heat. An aspect that may be grasped, by a mind capable of
contemplating general laws, in a flash of cognition after repeatedly observing
hot objects. The new scientific laws, however, could not be made to fit into
this mold.
</p>

<p>
At every point, the fundamental generalisations at the core of modern
scientific theories are unlike necessary first principles grasped with certainty
in a flash of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant
properties.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties"><h4 id="not sensible properties" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not sensible properties">not sensible properties</a></h4></div>
<p>
To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in scientific
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  By contrast, human sensory organs are
not sensitive to properties such as electric field strength, quantum spin or
quantum color (and if we can sense magnetic fields, the capacity is so
rudimentary as to be debatable. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0483-18.2019"><cite>Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from Alpha-Band Activity in the Human Brain</cite></a>, 2019).
</p>

<p>
Even the attributions of those properties that might be thought to be sensible,
such as wavelength and mass, is often at odds with ordinary sensations.  The
mass of an object, for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is
dependent upon gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras
the former remains unchanged even in micro-gravity. Thus even though we sense
something commonly correlated with mass (perhaps the force exerted on our
bodies when we support objects unaided) it seems we do not sense the mass of
objects.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths"><h4 id="not necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths">not necessary truths</a></h4></div>
<p>
The next difference is that scientific generalisations are not thought to be
true necessarily.  This claim's most influential advocate may be Popper, for
though he did not argue for it explicitly, it is implied by his well known
principle that scientific claims must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a>.  According to
Popper, a statement is falsifiable if and only if there is a possible <q>basic
statement</q> (i.e. a singular existential claim, such as <q>The needle on this
voltmeter is pointing to 11</q>) whose truth is <q>intersubjectively
testable</q> (i.e.  about which observers can come to agree despite other
differences in their beliefs) and with which that statement is incompatible.
But of course, necessary truths are compatible with every <q>basic statement</q>
and hence, by Popper's standard, no scientific principle is necessary.
</p>

<p>
Independently of Popper's standard for scientific enquiry, principles such as
the right hand rule governing the movement of charged particles through
magnetic fields have obvious symmetric alternatives that appear to be equally
plausible <em>a priori</em> and yet mutually exclusive. While other principles, such as
<q>Elements with eight electrons in their outer shell are inert</q> seem too
palpably arbitrary to be considered necessary.
</p>

<p>
In the other direction, while we may now be confident that Newtonian mechanics
is false, it is at least implausible that it is necessarily false.  Hence no
scientific theory incompatible with Newtonian mechanics can be necessarily true.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty"><h4 id="not known with certainty" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-not known with certainty">not known with certainty</a></h4></div>
<p>
While Popper formulated his falsification principle in the mid 20th century, by
1650 Descartes had already recognized that scientific claims gained credence
via their success in predicting observations( (??source??) ). For several centuries afterwards,
it was only dimly apprehended<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">by everyone apart, perhaps, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes">Reverend Thomas Bayes</a></span></span> that for an experience to give credence to a
hypothesis, <a href="if_some_experiences_confirm_others_must_infirm.html">there must be other possible experiences which would confute it</a>
(hence Popper's emphasis on falsification); but it <em>was</em> widely understood that
belief in scientific theories was justified by their success in predicting
observations and that they were <em>not deducible from</em> (reports of) those
observations.
</p>

<p>
There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10; and secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
<em>guarantee</em> the truth of the general scientific principles they support. Any
number of ????
general principle may have any number of positive instances
and yet be false. It ????
is possible for a supposedly universal law to be vindicated by any finite number
of observations and yet be false, hence, at least according to the traditional
theory of knowledge, those observations cannot justify believing that
principle with absolute certainty.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences"><h4 id="known less certainly than their consequences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-known less certainly than their consequences">known less certainly than their consequences</a></h4></div>
<p>
Another point of difference between scientific laws and Aristotelian first
principles, is that scientific laws are known with less certainty than the
particular cases fulfilling them; wheras geometrical and arithmetic laws are
known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they subsume.
</p>

<p>
Most of us, for instance, are more certain that addition is symmetric
(i.e. that for any pair of numbers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> + <em>m</em> = <em>m</em> + <em>n</em>) than that
38974298435982 + 87248912374 = 87248912374 + 38974298435982. A modern view may
ascribe this uncertainty to the difficulty of determining whether the particular
case presented falls under the general rule (i.e.  whether, among other things,
the sixth digit of the last number in the equation just given is the same as the
sixth digit in the first). Plato, by contrast, relied upon a looser and
more complex relationship between ordinary objects and the forms than
instantiation <em>simpliciter</em>; He held that ordinary objects realise forms only
imperfectly<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">see <a class="heavy" href="chisholm1987-truths_of_reason.html#Geometrical figures exist">Chisholm's discussion of geometrical figures</a> for a modern exponent of the view</span></span>.  This shortcoming means that ordinary sensible objects may fail
to fulfill the laws obtaining between the forms they imperfectly instantiate. In
either case the general law is more certain that its exemplification in any
given instance.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, scientific generalisations, even mundane ones such as <q>Blue
litmus paper turns red when immersed in acid</q> are known with less certainty
than particular observations of their instances.  Indeed on the modern view it
follows from fundamental principles of probability that such generalizations
must be less certain than observations of any particular positive instance.
For the falsehood of any of instance would render the universal claim false as
well, and hence the probability of the universal claim must be lower than the
probability of that claim being fulfilled in any particular case.
</p>

<p>
The final point of difference, which is also the most difficult to make sense of
from the modern viewpoint, is that scientific laws are not grasped in a flash of
insight after repeated sensation. After repeated encounters with circles, one
might in a sudden insight, realise that each is a set of points equidistant from
a centre. After repeated encounters with lines, one may realise that just one
line passes through any pair of distinct points. But one does not, after
repeatedly lifting heavy objects, suddenly realise that the gravitational
constant is 6.6743 +/- 0.00015 x 10<sup><small>-11</small></sup> Newton square meters per square
kilogram.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences"><h3 id="consequences of these differences" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-first problem: the justification of scientific theories-consequences of these differences">consequences of these differences</a></h3></div>
<p>
The differences just noted make it clear that knowledge of scientific
generalisations is not justified in the way prescribed by the traditional view.
Such is the tenacity and strength of the traditional view's hold on modern minds
however, that a dawning realisation that our knowledge of scientific truths is
not justified in this way often first manifests itself as skepticism; a denial
that we have knowledge of scientific generalizations at all.
</p>

<p>
So it was for Descartes, though he claimed his skepticism was merely
methodological.  The starting point of his <em>cogito</em> is the realisation that that
our theories of the external world cannot be deduced from observations and
necessary first principles, and hence our knowledge of them is dubious.  This
doubt became known as <q>Cartesian skepticism</q> and went on to become a
central problem of early modern philosophy<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">in Kant's words, <q>the scandal of philosophy</q></span></span>.  By contrast, Descartes' subsequent
attempt to place our knowledge of scientific theories on the same solid,
deductive, foundations as geometry and mathematics (via proofs that God existed
and would not deceive us) was derided as ridiculous by many of his
contemporaries<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">e.g.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Schoock&amp;oldid=1133182057">Martin Schook</a> in his (<a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dKxa3gAvWR8C">Admiranda methodus novae philosophiae Renati De Cartes</a>) </span></span>, and largely dismissed as a second rate addendum by his
successors.
</p>

<p>
So it remains for many philosophy students today. They often leave their first
year encounter with Cartesian skepticism convinced that the take home message of
philosophy is that no-one <em>really</em> knows anything except their own experiences
and perhaps some mathematics; i.e. truths of which the traditional account of
knowledge remains at least superficially plausible. Nor is this insistence upon
rejecting all claims of knowledge that are not justified by the lights of the
traditional view limited to pioneers and novices. Russell notes the wide spread
of this skepticism in his complaint that <q>&hellip; when people begin to
philosophize they seem to think it necessary to make themselves artificially
stupid</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><em>Theory of knowledge</em> from <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203875391"><cite>The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell</cite></a></span></span> (i.e. to reject all knowledge claims apart from those that can be
deduced from their own observations and first principles known with certainty).
</p>

<p>
Such skepticism is not the starting point of this work. Our knowledge of
scientific claims, such as the charge of electrons, the speed of light in a
vacuum (and its invariance), and that massive objects attract each other with a
force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, is far
better supported than the traditional account of the justification of knowledge.
If that traditional account implies that we do not have such knowledge, then it
is the traditional account itself, and not the claims to knowledge it denies
which must be rejected. What we seek is an account of reasoning and knowledge
that is compatible with our having knowledge<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">or whatever positive epistemological state it is held to be, if the term <q>knowledge</q> is reserved for those beliefs justified in accordance with traditional view</span></span> of both scientific generalisations
<em>and</em> the principles underpinning deductive inference.
</p>

<p>
Our mere possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations does not
immediately discredit the traditional account altogether. It does show that
account to be incomplete (i.e. that some knowledge is not justified in the way
that view specifies) but it does not show that <em>no</em> knowledge is justified in
that way. It is compatible with both the traditional account of knowledge, and
our possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations to hold that the
traditional view of knowledge is correct within some limited sphere, but that
there is also further knowledge beyond this sphere, of which it is not correct.
</p>

<p>
If the only problem posed for the traditional account of knowledge by the
growth in scientific knowledge was due to our <em>possession</em> of knowledge that was
not justified according to the traditional account; then this view
would be tenable. In addition to knowledge deduced from first principles known
with certainty there would be knowledge justified by our observations and
scientific methods. As our scientific understanding of the physical processes
underlying perception and belief formation developed, however, it became
increasingly apparent that there was a fundamental conflict between the
<em>content</em> of our scientific knowledge and the adequacy of the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning <em>even within its own sphere</em>.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories"><h2 id="second problem: the content of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories">second problem: the content of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
The first problem for the traditional account of knowledge was simply that we
<em>possess</em> knowledge that is not justified by the lights of that account. The
second problem is that the <em>content</em> of that knowledge is wildly incompatible 
with claims upon which the traditional account of reasoning and knowledge
relied.
</p>

<p>
St. Thomas Aquinas was probably the original, and certainly the most influential
author of the phrase <q>Nothing is in the mind that was not first in the
senses</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or rather, of the Latin phrase of which this is the English translation; viz., <q>Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu</q>.</span></span> but, quite fairly, he attributed the spirit of
this precept to Aristotle. It became a commonplace of medieval scholastic
philosophy, discussed by Bonaventure, Matthew of Aquasparta, and Duns Scotus.
The truth of the dictum does not directly concern us here, what does concern us
is that it makes clear the traditional commitment to our concepts being the same
as the properties presented in our sensations.  Even Plato, who held our
knowledge of the forms to be memories from a previous life in a divine realm
where we had contemplated those forms directly, also held that the poor sensible
copies presented by our senses in this world were yet close enough to spark our
remembrance of their perfect originals. Of course, philosophers being what they
are, these views are riven by further dispute. St Thomas claimed that the
<q>active intellect</q> which enabled us to grasp the universal properties
exemplified in our sensations, was an aspect of individual human intellects;
wheras his predecessor Ibn Sina held there to be just one active intellect
common to all humans, and St. Augustine considered this one common element to be
God's divine illumination. Grouping all these views under the title of <q>the
traditional account</q> is not intended to deny the profound differences between
and amongst Platonists and Aristotelians, but simply to emphasise that the
belief that that our concepts are identical with (or at least similar to) the
properties of our sensations, was an orthodoxy amongst European and Arabic
philosophers from Aristotle up until Descartes.
</p>

<p>
According to the traditional account, not only were the properties of our
sensations the same as the concepts in our minds, they were also the properties
of the physical objects around us. As Aristotle put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
By a 'sense' is meant what has the power of receiving into itself the
sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be conceived of as
taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a
signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that what produces the
impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its particular metallic
constitution makes no difference: in a similar way the sense is affected by
what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent what in
each case the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has
<br>( <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8bh0gh94"><cite>De Anima</cite></a>, Book II, Section 12)
</blockquote>
<p>
The colour of the distant red object is, through the light created
transparency of the intervening air, able to impress itself on the parts of
the eye that were sensitive to it. The property present in the sensitive parts
of the eye (and by which those parts are affected) is the very same as the
property of the distant object.
</p>

<p>
This triple identity, between the concepts by which we think of objects, the
forms realised without matter in our sensations, and the forms realised by the
material objects that we perceive and think of, was supposed to ensure that our
concepts <em>are</em> the properties of the objects around us.  In Aquinas' words:
<q>The intellect, by the act of understanding, is made one with the object
understood</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Nam intellectus, secundum hoc quod actu intelligit, secundum hoc fit unum cum intellecto.<br>Darcy, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4544136"><cite>Knowledge According to Aquinas</cite></a>, 1903</span></span>; or as Cajetan, a later influential commentator on Aquinas put it
<q>to know is nothing else than for the intellect to be [the thing known] and
the species is the form whereby it comes to that being.</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Darcy, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4544136"><cite>Knowledge According to Aquinas</cite></a>, 1903</span></span> We moderns may
wonder at this somewhat mystical unity between acts of cognition and the objects
cognized<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Aquinas held it to be the same unity as obtains between Jesus, the word of God, and God the father, who is the source of that word.</span></span>, and scholars continue to dispute various interpretations of
Aristotle's account of the relationships between substances, species, forms and
universals; but what is clear, in modern terms, is that the properties possessed
by the objects around us, the properties presented in our immaterial sensations
and the concepts by which we think of those objects were held to be the same.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was because the properties we were manipulating in our imaginations,
memories and intellects were the very same as the properties instantiated by the
material objects around us, that the manipulations we could or could not perform
in thought reflected the combinations of properties that could or could not be
realised in objects outside our minds. Our minds were in direct contact with the
properties of the external world and hence reason, the capacity to abstract
those universal properties from particular instances, could give us insight
into the necessary relationships between those properties.
</p>

<p>
All of these claims were directly, unequivocally and irrefutably discredited by
scientific discoveries.
</p>

<p>
The history of the collapse of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning is complicated by the fact that the traditional Aristotelian theories
of sensation and knowledge were not directly replaced by scientific theories
based upon experiment and observation, but were instead swept away by a wave of
wild speculation with only a tenuous connection to empirical evidence
(see <a class="heavy" href="timeline-modern_atomism_to_nerve_impulses.html">timeline: modern atomism to nerve impulses</a>).
</p>

<p>
At the start of the 17th century Galileo set off a wave of speculative physics
that spread over Europe. However, while Galileo himself certainly believed a
variety of speculative theories, his most significant discoveries were closely
based on observation and experiment.  His treatise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidereus_Nuncius"><cite>The Starry Messenger</cite></a> (1610)
contained the first report of observations of heavenly bodies made through a
telescope; and his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&amp;oldid=1166797169#Day_three:_Naturally_accelerated_motion"><cite>Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences</cite></a><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">The two new sciences being <em>statics</em> [the strength of unmoving structures] and <em>kinetics</em> [the motion of objects].</span></span> (1638)
contained a quantitative description of the distance travelled by
<q>naturally</q> falling bodies<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">i.e. bodies falling solely under the influence of gravity</span></span> (viz., that <q>the spaces traversed were to each
other as the squares of the times</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">e.g. a body will fall four times as far in two seconds as it does in one</span></span>&zwj;) and described measurements he had made
of a bronze ball rolling down an inclined plane which confirmed his claim. His
private notebooks also reveal a wealth of experiments, though these were
downplayed in his published work, where he tended to present his claims as
deducible from first principles.
</p>

<p>
The bodily mechanisms involved in movement and sensation were a particularly
attractive topic of speculation. From the outset Galileo realised that if
mechanistic theories were to be plausible they would have to explain our
sensations of colour, taste and scent as arising from mechanical interactions
between the external bodies and our sensory organs.  Indeed this was the main
focus of his 1623 work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assayer"><cite>The Assayer</cite></a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to inhere, these
tastes, odors, colors, etc., are nothing but empty names; rather they inhere
only in the sensitive body, such that if one removes the animal, then all
these qualities are taken away and annihilated.
</blockquote>

<p>
Hobbes was one such speculator, offering an explicitly mechanistic, albeit
cursory, theory of the transmission of sensory signals:
</p>
<blockquote>
The cause of Sense is the External Body, or Object, which presseth the
organ proper to each Sense, .  . . which pressure, by the mediation of
Nerves, and other strings, and membranes of the body, continued inwards to
the Brain and Heart<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Leviathan/The_First_Part&amp;oldid=9608826#Chapter_I:_Of_Sense"><cite>Leviathan</cite></a>, Chap. I, 1651)
</blockquote>

<p>
Descartes was another:
</p>
<blockquote>
I would have you consider the light in bodies we call <q>luminous</q> to be
nothing other than a certain movement, or very rapid and lively action,
which passes to our eyes through the medium of the air and other transparent
bodies, just as the movement or resistance of the bodies encountered by a
blind man passes to his hand by means of his stick. &hellip;
Hence you will have reason to conclude that there is no need to suppose that
something material passes from objects to our eyes to make us see colours
and light, or even that there is something in the objects which resembles
the ideas or sensations that we have of them.<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dioptrique&amp;oldid=1184902374"><cite>Optics</cite></a>, 1637, via <a href="../zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf">descartes1-philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes</a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
Although the paucity of the evidence upon which Descartes and Hobbes based their
speculations is remarkable (as was their aversion to laboratory work) it is
clear that many people now <em>know</em>, what mechanistic natural philosophers such as
Galileo, Descartes and Hobbes may have only <em>believed</em>: The surfaces of well lit
middle sized objects such as tables and chairs are radically different to the
streams of particles travelling from those surfaces to our eyes, which are again
radically different to what happens at the backs of our eyes as they are stuck
by those particles, which is again radically different to the impulses sent from
our eyes to parts of the brain, which is again different from the activity in
our brains (and if that gives rise to mental entities or properties such as
sensations or qualia then those are yet different again).
</p>

<p>
Whether the theories of mechanistic natural philosophers are lauded as the
best explanations of physiological processes of sensation and bodily movement
available at the time; or derided as restricted to an implausibly austere range
of fundamental interactions too limited to do justice to either human behaviour
or natural phenomena; speculative belief in mechanistic theories eventually led
to and was replaced by belief in the well supported empirical theories of modern
science.  The empirical successes of those theories have irretrievably shattered
the illusion that our minds have anything remotely describable as direct contact
with the properties of the objects around us. The loss of that illusion took
with it the traditional account of reasoning that had explained our capacity for
insight into the modal relationships between the properties of the objects
around us.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first problem</a>, which merely implied that the traditional account of
knowledge and reasoning was incomplete, the new discoveries about the
physiological processes underpinning sensation were outright incompatible with
the traditional account. If the properties of our sensations and thoughts are
not the same as the properties of the objects they represent then the
traditional account of knowledge is false. In particular, the traditional
explanation of the consonance between the properties we can combine <q>in the
intellect</q> and the combinations of properties that external objects can
realise, collapses.
</p>

<p>
The incompatibility of the new understanding of the physiological processes
underpinning sensation, with the ancient account of knowledge and reasoning,
does not compel skepticism about our ability to reason. Even if the
traditional account is false and we have no better alternative to offer in its
place, that does not imply that we cannot distinguish good from bad reasoning,
nor that we cannot reason our way to justified beliefs, but only that we are
ignorant of how we have these abilities. The lack of a plausible epistemological
theory no more casts doubt on our capacity to reason than ignorance of the
physiology of the eye casts doubt on our ability to see. In both cases, however,
a deeper understanding of the processes involved can give greater insight into
when they are liable to go wrong, and make us more able to spot charlatans; and
in neither case is the naive account of how these processes function or what
they reveal to us beyond question.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a yet more fundamental aspect of the conflict between our
understanding of ourselves as creatures whose physiologies obey the same
physical principles as the rest of the natural world, and our understanding of
ourselves as reasoning beings, which does threaten skepticism.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories-insensitive to necessity and possibility"><h4 id="insensitive to necessity and possibility" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-second problem: the content of scientific theories-insensitive to necessity and possibility">insensitive to necessity and possibility</a></h4></div>
<p>
With the doubtful exception of quantum mechanics, all the objects described in
our scientific theories are utterly unresponsive to mere possibilities. The
moving bodies postulated in both Newtonian mechanics and general relativity
alter their velocity only in response to actual forces such as the impact of
another object, the influence of a magnetic field or of gravitation.  The mere
possibility that an object might be struck or the possibility of magnetic flux
has no effect upon such bodies whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
In reasoning, at least as it has been understood in the European philosophical
tradition since the time of the ancient Greeks till today, we appear to have
access to truths concerning possibility and necessity. Reason reveals to us not
only that each triangle's internal angles sum to two right angles, but that
they <em>must</em> do so. On the other hand, the merest possibility of rain tomorrow
may motivate us to take an umbrella.  The latter may be explicable as a mere
appearance. The apparent influence of a future possibility may, upon further
reflection, be attributed to the effect of various actual objects and events
present and past; the looming of dark clouds, the weather reporter's confident
assertion that it will rain and so on. In the case of our ability to reason,
however, our sensitivity to modal truths is not so easily dismissed.  An
argument is valid just in case it is impossible for its premises to be true and
its conclusion false; and reasoning is supposed, amongst other things, to enable
us to distinguish valid from invalid arguments.
</p>

<p>
In our reasoning capacities we appear to display a sensitivity to possibility
and necessity that is unlike any of the objects revealed to us by scientific
enquiry. It thus seems impossible for reasoning beings such as ourselves to
be made from the modally insensitive materials postulated in our best
scientific theories.

<p>
Initially, it was the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#first problem: the justification of scientific theories">first of these two problems</a> that appeared most pressing
and received the greatest attention from European philosophers.  As awareness
of these problems spread, however, there was an inversion in where the center
of the epistemological difficulties was supposed to lie and the <a href="collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#second problem: the content of scientific theories">second problem</a>
came to be seen as more critical.
</p>

<p>
At first the chief difficulty was thought to be our knowledge of contingent
external objects via the senses and it was the nature of the justification of
that knowledge that received the most attention. Descartes' concern was
that the senses are dubious and he sought to show why and under what
circumstances they warranted absolute confidence.  By contrast, he
took our knowledge of truths of mathematics, and of truths underpinning valid
arguments such as his cogito to be indubitable<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Descartes is inconstant on this point. Sometimes he asserts that it is within God's power to deceive us even about such truths.  This even engenders a well known circularity in Descartes' arguments.  But God's power to deceive us about such truths remains an afterthought for Descartes, intended to ensure compatibility with God's omnipotence. By contrast, the main conclusion of the cogito is that we can trust the senses only because the existence of a God who does not deceive us can be <em>deduced</em> from the certain knowledge of one's own existence and thoughts</span></span>:
</p>
<blockquote>
let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am
nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something; or make it true at
some future time that I have never existed, since it is now true that I
exist; or bring it about that two and three added together are more or less
than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction.
<br>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511818998"><cite>Third Meditation</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Descartes' attempt to reconcile the traditional account of knowledge with our
knowledge of scientific theories (via God's grace) was never widely accepted.
Instead, eventually, the traditional account of the justification of knowledge
by experience was simply rejected. Though elements of the traditional view
lingered long in the shadowy corners of our languages and intuitions, when
considered directly and explicitly, scientific principles were no longer held to
be necessarily true first principles, nor deducible from them, nor known with
certainty.
</p>

<p>
According to the developing scientific theories, the casual connections
between external objects and our experiences were not necessary, nor did they
simply imprint the properties of external objects onto our sensations.
Nevertheless, it was still accepted that that there were, at least when things
went well, causal chains running from external objects, via experiences, to the
formation of beliefs true of those objects.  Once attempts to tighten the links
in these chains sufficiently to satisfy the traditional account of knowledge
were abandoned, less stringent standards of knowledge were proposed<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Nozick&amp;oldid=1172878738#Epistemology">Nozick</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_Williamson&amp;oldid=1166387750#Philosophical_work">Williamson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duncan_Pritchard&amp;oldid=1036160614#Academic_studies">Pritchard's</a> proposals are currently the best known.</span></span> that chains
of contingent causation could support (some with less stringent standards of
necessity to go with them<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><q>safety is a sort of local necessity</q> - Williamson, <a href="https://www.amherstlecture.org/williamson2009/"><cite>Probability and Danger</cite></a>, 2009</span></span> ). Of course none of these alternatives was quite
the same as the full strength original, and vigorous discussion of their
various shortcomings continues to this day. Doubtful philosophers continued,
however, to find solace in the causal connections between our beliefs<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Or at least our assertions.</span></span> and the
objects of which those beliefs were true. According to our best scientific
theories, the empirical evidence which justifies our beliefs in contingent
truths (whether that evidence is taken to be other beliefs, experiences,
stimuli, tracks in the sand or noises in the distance) can causally affect the
formation of our beliefs.  Hence it seems possible for creatures displaying
roughly our level of success in believing only justified contingent statements
and assessing the justifications of others' beliefs in contingent statements, to
be constructed from the natural materials described by science.  Although it was
only slowly and reluctantly accepted that our knowledge of contingent truths,
such as those comprising our scientific theories was not justified in the way
specified by the traditional account of knowledge, and the details of just how
our experiences justified that knowledge are still disputed, there did not
appear to be a fundamental conflict between our sensitivity to the justification
of contingent statements (and hence our knowledge of contingent truths) and our
scientific understanding of the world.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the incompatibility between our scientific theories and our
apparent knowledge of necessary truths (and capacity for deductive reasoning)
appeared more pressing and more irresolvable the more it was considered. Our
capacity to gain knowledge of necessary truths seemed both indispensable to and
incompatible with our scientific discoveries. One difficulty is that many
necessary truths (such as those of arithmetic) appear to refer to
objects that are not located in space and time. Objects that are hence incapable
of playing any part in causing the formation of beliefs about them<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">In the more recent philosophical literature this is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Benacerraf&amp;oldid=1172032726#Philosophical_work">Benecerraf's epistemological problem or Beneceraff's dilemma</a> </span></span>.
Another apparent difficulty is that according to the traditional view we are,
despite our frequent errors in reasoning, justified in believing some necessary
truths with absolute certainty. But any causal psychological process by which
confidence is produced will be subject to malfunctioning and hence though it may
produce a <em>feeling</em> of absolute certainty (or at least a feeling that we
customarily describe as absolute certainty) such certainty could never be
justified by any causal psychological process<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">The point is roughly Hume's, though he draws from this claim the conclusion that we can never have any confidence in our judgements at all:<q>In every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well as concerning knowledge, we ought always to correct the first judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the object, by another judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the understanding. ’Tis certain a man of solid sense and long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire; since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and must still dread the like for the future.</q> <a href="hume1739-treatiseHumanNature.html"><cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite></a></span></span>.  More generally, as noted above,
the objects described in scientific theories, unlike elements of the processes
by which we hold our beliefs to be formed, appear to be utterly insensitive to
modal relations. As <a href="hume.html">Hume</a> pointed out vigorously and to great effect,
the supposedly necessary connexions between causes and their effects do not,
themselves, cause any experiences in us (or cause our beliefs to change by other
means).
</p>

<p>
The problem is not merely that terms such as <q>knowledge</q> and <q>justification</q>
cannot be translated into the terminology of physics or some other science
(though such a translation would provide a conclusive solution to the
problem).  The term <q>bridge</q> may be untranslatable into the language of
physics<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">One problem is vagueness and borderline cases. Is an ant-bridge a bridge?  A tree that falls across a river but rots away without any creature crossing over it? Another is the seemingly infinitely diverse ways in which bridges might be constructed of physical materials [unless there is some maximum size for bridges].</span></span>, but the capacity of some particular bridge to bear a load of a
million tons or survive a one-in-a-hundred-year earthquake is explicable in
physical terms. As some 21st century philosophers are wont to say, the
features that make something a useable bridge are <em>grounded</em> by its
physical properties.  There appears to be no such hope of grounding our
sensitivity to modal properties and relations in the physical properties of the
materials from which, according to our current best scientific theories, our
brains and bodies are constructed. Just as it seems impossible to construct a
device for detecting magnetic fields purely from materials utterly unaffected by
magnetism, so too it seems impossible for creatures who are capable of
distinguishing necessary from contingent truths (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Validity_(logic)&amp;oldid=1170722969">valid</a> from invalid
arguments) to be constructed purely from materials utterly unaffected by modal
relationships and properties.
</p>

<p>
Appearing initially as a felt need for a guarantee of correspondence between
our concepts and the properties they represent (the starting point for the
traditional account of our capacity to reason) resolving the conflict between
our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings sensitive to modal
relationships, and the scientific understanding of ourselves as physical systems
constructed from modally insensitive materials, came to be regarded as the
fundamental problem of philosophy.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-knowledge of necessary truths regarded as the fundamental problem of modern philosophy-regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers"><h3 id="regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-knowledge of necessary truths regarded as the fundamental problem of modern philosophy-regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers">regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers</a></h3></div>
<p>
Largely because of the repeated failure of attempts to resolve this conflict,
many philosophers now doubt that there is any such thing as <em>the</em> fundamental
problem of philosophy. Not only have those attempts failed to re-establish
rational foundations upon which grand philosophical systems could be built
(foundations that had been washed away in the collapse of the traditional
account of reasoning) their failure has also cast doubt on the idea of there
being an overarching standard of good reasoning at all. Some philosophers came
to view philosophy as a collection of more or less independent traditions or
projects, each with its own standards for assessing the truth of its
practitioners claims; and no way of judging one project as more central or
fundamental than another.  Even among those those who retained belief in an
overarching standard of reasoning, some believed that difficulties in
distinguishing the necessary consequences of ordinary assertions were so
profound as to raise doubt over whether propositions (<em>a fortiori</em> philosophical
problems) could be cleanly distinguished from one another at all. Even if such
concerns are well founded, however, they are largely foreign to modern
Anglo-European philosophy prior to the second half of the 20th century.
</p>

<p>
Since Galileo's publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&amp;oldid=1166797169"><cite>Two New Sciences</cite></a> in 1638, just two movements
have achieved such dominance over Anglo-European philosophy that they may
reasonably be called orthodoxies. The first was founded by Kant and its members
were those whose views were developments, direct or indirect, of the views
expressed in Kant's works, most notably his <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite></a>.
The second was Analytic philosophy. There have been times when neither
of these movements dominated Anglo-European philosophy, and individual countries
in which, for a time, other philosophical movements have dominated, but no other
movement has come remotely close to the level of international influence
and popularity possessed by these two at their heights.
</p>

<p>
Analytic philosophy's dominance amongst American philosophers in the late
20th century is described unambiguously by John Searl:
</p>
<blockquote>
Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States
are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in
the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic
philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the
analytic tradition — such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism,
existentialism, or Marxism —feel it necessary to define their position in
relation to analytic philosophy.<br>
(<em>Contemporary Philosophy in the United States</em> in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/b.9780631219088.2002.00021.x"><cite>The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy</cite></a><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Note this doi is not properly maintained by Wiley - ISBN: 978-0-631-21908-8</span></span>, 2002)
</blockquote>
<p>
In other English speaking countries Analytic philosophy held much the same
dominance. In continental Europe, however, while there were some circles of
highly influential Analytic philosophers, the lingering influence of various
outgrowths of Kantianism prevented Analytic philosophy from achieving the
same dominance.
</p>

<p>
Analytic philosophy was named by its own members for an at least nominally
shared method of gaining knowledge of necessary truths (viz., analysis).
Its members tended to see themselves as practicing a form of philosophy
distinctively different to those that had come before, and explicitly identified
themselves and their professional institutions as engaged with specifically
<em>Analytic</em> philosophy. Kantianism, by contrast, was named for its founder, and
its members tended to see themselves as engaging with shared ideas rather than
as members of a common movement. Though Kantians celebrated Kant's <q>Copernican
revolution</q> they generally saw themselves as distinguishing the ambitions of
traditional philosophy that could be fulfilled from those that could not, and
fulfilling those that could; as practicing philosophy, informed by Kant's
discoveries, rather than as practicing a new form of philosophy altogether.
Finally, neither Analytic philosophers nor Kantians regarded the theses proposed
by their movements' founding figures as established truths. Instead, those
theses were generally regarded as promising suggestions.  Suggestions that
might, with some combination of revision and refinement, be developed into true
theories.  For all these reasons, while the boundaries of the membership and
doctrines of both movements are somewhat vague and porous, those of Kantianism
are more so.
</p>

<p>
Kantianism's boundaries may be less clear-cut than those of Analytic philosophy
but its dominance over the European philosophy of its day is not. By the start
of the 19th century versions of Kant's philosophy were taught in every major
German speaking university and students flocked to his home town of
K&ouml;nigsberg, which was regarded as a shrine of philosophy. Indeed Kant's
philosophy was so highly regarded that his influence extended beyond the narrow
confines of philosophy and his opinions were sought on public affairs<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">see Bird, Otto Allen and Duignan, Brian. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant/Last-years">https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant/Last-years</a> . Accessed 19 December 2023.</span></span>.
Of course, even during the (first) height of Kantianism's dominance (just after
Kant's death in 1804) European philosophy was noted more for its debates than
its points of widespread agreement, but:
</p>
<blockquote>
Remarkably, almost everyone of importance in the debates, apart from the
parties of metaphysics, faith, and common sense, seemed to profess to be
philosophizing <q>in the Kantian spirit</q>.<br>
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CHO9780511975257"><cite>Cambridge History of Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Just as with Analytic philosophy, in its heyday Kantianism was the orthodoxy in
relation to which practitioners of other forms of philosophy had to define their
positions in order to make their work generally accessible to other European
philosophers.
</p>

<p>
Both Kantianism and Analytic philosophy were based around accounts of our
knowledge of necessary truths. Each movement's founding figures offered
accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths and claimed that those accounts
would, if fully developed, allow us to distinguish good reasoning from bad, and
thereby put philosophy on a solid footing. Kant claimed that his account of the
justification of our knowledge of necessary truths would <q>serve as the
touchstone of the value, or lack of value, or all <em>a priori</em> cognitions</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Here, as is usual for him, Kant phrases the problem in terms of <em>a priori</em> knowledge, rather than knowledge of necessary truths. However he held that all and only truths known <em>a priori</em> could be known to be necessarily true: <q>any cognition that is to hold <em>a priori</em> proclaims on its own that it wants to be regarded as absolutely necessary</q> (<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a>, Preface A) and <q>if we find a proposition such that in thinking it we think at the same time its necessity, then it is an <em>a priori</em> judgment</q><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>CPR</cite></a> , Introduction B). Hence, at least by his standards the questions concerning the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths, and our capacity for <em>a priori</em> judgements are equivalent. </span></span>
(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite></a>, introduction), <q>will make reason secure in its
rightful claims and will dismiss all baseless pretensions</q>(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>ibid.</cite></a>, preface A)
and put philosophy <q>on the secure path of a science</q>(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>ibid.</cite></a>, preface B).
While for his part, Bertrand Russell claimed that his new form of philosophy,
which proceeded by <q>logical analysis, followed by logical synthesis</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203864777">russell1918-logicalAtomism</a></span></span>,
<q>introduced the same kind of advance into philosophy as Galileo introduced
into physics, making it possible at last to see what kinds of problems may be
capable of solution, and what kinds must be abandoned as beyond human
powers</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Our_Knowledge_of_the_External_World_as_a_Field_for_Scientific_Method_in_Philosophy&oldid=11530349">russell1914-knowledgeOfExternalWorld</a></span></span>.  According to Russell this new method of analysis would enable
philosophers to <q>obtain results that do not merely embody personal
idiosyncrasies, but must command the assent of all who are competent to form an
opinion</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Our_Knowledge_of_the_External_World_as_a_Field_for_Scientific_Method_in_Philosophy&oldid=11530349">russell1914-knowledgeOfExternalWorld</a></span></span>.
</p>

<p>
If it were just the members of these two movements who regarded explaining our
knowledge of necessary truths as the fundamental problem of philosophy, that
alone would be sufficient to warrant the claim that modern Anglo-European
philosophers generally (though of course not universally) regarded this problem
as <em>the</em> fundamental problem of philosophy. But in fact, this view was already
widespread amongst philosophers <em>prior</em> to these movements. Anxieties regarding
the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths predated the rise of
these movements, and it was because these movements appeared to offer solutions
that could allay those anxieties that they gained their extraordinary influence.
(Though of course, as successful salesmen are wont to, these movements' members
promoted the problem to which they thought they had a solution.)
</p>

<p>
Each of these two movements movement grew in popularity while its account of our
knowledge of necessary truths was regarded as plausible, and began to
disintegrate when its account was discredited. In neither case, of course, was
this disintegration instantaneous. For a time stylistic and social factors
continued to act as unifying forces; but without a unifying approach to
explaining the foundations of our knowledge of necessary truths, their members'
senses of what constituted good philosophical work drifted apart, and they
gradually fell into a range of factions with less and less in common.
</p>

<p>
Members of these two movements were some, but by no means all, of 
the Anglo-European philosophers who believed that an
account of the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths would provide
a touchstone for evaluating philosophical claims and resolving philosophical
disputes; and that without such a touchstone two <q>awkward facts</q> about
philosophy [as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/arisoc/aow020">Chris Daly (2016)</a> describes them] would continue to be true:
<q>First, no philosophical problems have been solved; second, philosophers
cannot agree about anything beyond that</q>. It is in this sense that modern
Anglo-European philosophers generally came, at least for a time, to regard
providing an account of the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths
as <em>the</em> fundamental problem of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
The latest major development in the long collapse of the traditional
account of knowledge, has been a general loss of confidence in the
central project of Analytic philosophy - viz., to explain our knowledge of
necessary truths in terms of meanings and empirically acquired linguistic
competence, thereby reconciling our capacity to reason and discern the necessary
consequences of our beliefs with our scientific theories. In less than 50 years
the central tenets of Analytic philosophy (such as the doctrine that all
necessary truths are true by virtue of meaning alone, and our sensitivity to the
justification of necessary truths can (only) be explained in terms of our
knowledge of the meanings of our statements) went from being orthodoxies to
being viewed as <q>decidely antique</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Soames, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400825790"><cite>Philosophical Analysis in the 20th century</cite></a>, (2003)&zwj;</span></span> doctrines, held true by <q>very few
philosophers</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400825790">ibid.,</a></span></span>.
</p>

<p>
One of the causes of this rapid decline, was the increased scope offered for
metaphysical speculation. Both Kantian and Analytic philosophers had denounced
the temptations of metaphysical speculation and its appeal to <q>vanity and
convenience</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans</a></span></span>. Of course, they drew the line between productive philosophy
and metaphysical speculation in different ways. According to Kant we
stray into metaphysical speculation when we claim to have knowledge of
things <q>as they are in themselves</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">ibid.,</a></span></span> rather than <q>only insofar as they appear to
us</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0">ibid.,</a></span></span>. According to Analytic philosophers it is when we claim to
have knowledge of necessary truths that are not true due to the linguistic
proprieties of the language in which they are expressed. Both these boundaries
were, of course, disputed; as was the question of whether philosophy (or
science) could be done entirely without metaphysical speculation.
Regardless of the coherence of these limits, or how well Kantian and
Analytic philosophers abided by them, the speed and generality with which the
central tenets of Analytic philosophy fell into disrepute was certainly assisted
by the prospect of silencing the critics of metaphysical speculation and once
again openly indulging in this traditional philosophical sport.
</p>

<p>
While the temptations of metaphysical speculation were among the <em>causes</em> of the
general loss of confidence in Analytic philosophy (and in particular in the
claim that all necessary truths were analytic) the <em>reasons</em> for this loss of
confidence stemmed from two quite distinct problems raised by Analytic
philosophy's critics:
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-justification of analyses"><h4 id="justification of analyses" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-justification of analyses">justification of analyses</a></h4></div>
<p>
The first problem concerned the nature of the evidence for Analytic
philosophers analyses. In <a href="../zz.texts/quine1961-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf"><cite>Two Dogmas of Empiricism</cite></a> (1951), one of the most
influential philosophy papers of the second half of the 20th century, Quine
alleged that our epistemic access to the property of analyticity was every bit
as unclear as our epistemic access to ascriptions of necessity.  Although the
structure, premises, and even conclusions of Quine's arguments are still
debated, the continuing inability of analytic philosophers to provide a
generally accepted account of how to determine whether or not a sentence of an
unfamiliar language is analytic was more than merely embarrassing. Difficulties
which, up until that point, had been thought to be merely technical<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Such as the failure of reduction in Carnap's <em>Aufbau der Welt</em>.</span></span>, came to
be suspected of being symptoms of a fundamental problem. In particular, it was
unclear whether Analytic philosophers' claims to reveal statements' hidden
logical/semantic/conceptual structure by analysis of their meanings, were any
more capable of being justified by empirical evidence than ascriptions of
necessity had been in the first place.

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-a posteriori necessities"><h4 id="a posteriori necessities" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-loss of confidence in accounts of knowledge of necessary truths as analytic-a posteriori necessities">a posteriori necessities</a></h4></div>
<p>
The second problem concerned seemingly plausible examples of <em>a posteriori</em>
necessary truths presented by Saul Kripke and Hilary Putnam such as
<q>Hesperus is Phosphorous</q> and <q>Water is H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O</q>. Clearly the truth of such
statements cannot be determined purely by analysis of their meanings, and so if
they are indeed necessary truths, then they are counterexamples to the claim
that all necessary truths are analytic. As one commentator put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
Kripke's famous conclusion that necessary truths can sometimes be known a
posteriori and that some contingent truths may be known a priori is
incompatible with treating statements of necessary truth as disguised
expressions of linguistic norms which, being products of stipulation, must
be known a priori.
<br>(Loomis, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20118231"><cite>Necessity, the A Priori, and the Standard Meter</cite>, 1999</a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence the explanation of our knowledge of ascriptions of necessity via
analyticity was at best incomplete, and our knowledge of at least some
necessary truths must be justified by other means.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives"><h2 id="three alternatives" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives">three alternatives</a></h2></div>
<p>
The loss of confidence in Analytic approaches to explaining our knowledge of
necessary truths did not introduce a new approach to reconciling our scientific
theories with our capacity to reason.
The basic alternatives explored by philosophers in the wake of that loss of
confidence, had all been considered
</p>

<p>
explored before that loss, The fundamental alternatives
explored by, philosophers in the wake of this loss of confidence had all been
known 
</p>

<p>
At a sufficiently fundamental level, the basic alternatives explored by
philosophers in the wake of this loss of confidence had all been explored
before. Philosophers were however, led to reconsider fundamental alternatives
that had previously been rejected in favour of analytic approaches.
</p>

<p>
The three fundamental alternatives are:
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives-abandon naturalism"><h4 id="abandon naturalism" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives-abandon naturalism">abandon naturalism</a></h4></div>
<p>
The first alternative is to abandon the claim that the laws and principles
governing the rest of the natural world (and fallibly and incompletely
described in our empirically justified scientific theories) are the only laws
that govern our actions and the formation of our beliefs. Reject the
naturalistic constraints that both Kantian and Analytic philosophers aspired to
abide by. Accept reason as an extra-empirical source of substantive knowledge
about the necessary structure of the world (much as the ancient Greeks had
thought geometry to be) and a causal influence on our actions that is altogether
omitted from the scientific image of the world.
</p>

<p>
One form this alternative can take is, of course, an open return to Aristotelian
philosophy (despite its implausible theory of perception) and, indeed, there has
been a marked resurgence of interest in Aristotelian epistemology and metaphysic
since the late 20th century.
</p>

<p>
Other forms this alternative can take include the various new versions of modal
realism advocated by philosophers such as David Lewis and Kit Fine<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Whether Kripke's account of our modal knowledge is a form of rationalism is debatable</span></span>.
According to their accounts, the truth-makers of modal truths are
either other possible worlds just as real as the actual world we inhabit, or at
at least aspects of the actual world which exist independently of our attitudes
towards them.  There is, of course, no widely accepted account of our epistemic
access to these truths.  Our knowledge of them is variously attributed to a raw
intuitive ability to gain insight into <q>the necessary character of reality</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">BonJour, <a href="http://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511625176"><cite>In Defense of Pure Reason: A Rationalist Account of A Priori Justification</cite>, 1997</a></span></span>,
an ability to perceive modal relationships akin to either our perception of
physical objects(????Bealer????) or our introspective awareness of our own
thoughts, or a sensitivity to the unity and economy of our overall
theories<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net//ark:/13960/t16n0s46p">lewis1986-pluralityOfWorlds</a></span></span>. In any case, our capacity to reason is once again supposed to give us
knowledge of substantive features of the world which, although completely
omitted from our scientific theories, nonetheless affect (or are at least
correlated with) the formation of beliefs which go on to affect our actions.
</p>

<p>
This is the alternative that has gained the most advocates as a result of the
loss of confidence in Analytic approaches to explaining our knowledge of
necessary truths. Those who openly embrace this rejection of naturalism, have
quite accurately described the renewed popularity of these approaches as a
<q>rationalist rennaissance</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Bealer, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198250890.001.0001"><cite>Modal Epistemology and the Rationalist Renaissance</cite></a>, 2002</span></span>
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives-reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessity"><h4 id="reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessity" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives-reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessity">reconcile naturalism with knowledge of necessity</a></h4></div>
<p>
The second option is to hold out hope that some way of reconciling our capacity
to distinguish (at least some) necessary truths with our scientific theories may
yet be discovered. To hold that that either the objections to Analytic
philosophy are flawed and its central claim, that all necessary truths are true
by virtue of their meanings (meanings to which the epistemic access of competent
speakers can be explained as a product of a natural process of language
learning) is true after all; or that Analytic philosophers were mistaken when
they claimed that this was the only way in which our knowledge of necessary
truths might be reconciled with naturalistic accounts of the formation of our
beliefs.
</p>

<p>
This was, of course, the alternative to which mainstream Analytic philosophers
were committed
</p>

<p>
The grand promise of analytic philosophy, and it is this alternative
that has suffered the greatest decrease in popularity as 
</p>

<p>
However, both optimism and sheer inertia, have meant that it remains the most
popular option ddespite despite this loss
of popularity 
</p>


<p>
in the 2020 PhilPaper survey 62% of respondents <q>accepted or leant towards</q> the
claim that there are analytic truths [though not that all necessary truths were
analytic]
while 44% <q>accepted or leant towards</q> empiricism.
</p>

<p>
One of the manifestations of this approach has been a variety of attempts to
provide 
</p>

<p>
an account of meaning that is both strong enough to support notions of
synonymy and analyticity, and epistemically accessible to competent speakers by
naturalistic means.
</p>

<p>
or that Analytic philosophers were mistaken
when they held this to be the only approach to explaining our knowledge of
necessary truths that was compatible with our scientific theories. Most commonly
a combination of these two is attempted, with attempts to explain <em>a priori</em>
truths as analytic,
</p>

<p>
while the phrase <q><em>a posteriori</em> necessary truth</q> has raised hopes that
knowledge of the statements it is true might be justified by empirical
observations after all. Though again no attempt to explain how this may be done
have gained widespread acceptance.
</p>

<p>
but we must also count as taking this option those who have no idea how these
problems may be solved, but are still influenced by the reasons that led them to
take up analytic philosophy in the first place, to think there 
</p>

<p>
Those who, willing or unwillingly find themselves taking this option, sometimes
take comfort in claiming that philosophy never makes progress regarding the
current situation as a true SNAFU. 
</p>

<p>
For want of any better idea take comfort in the claim that philosophy has never
made progress and the current lack of solutions is simply 
inability to resolve the problems it raises 
is normally unable to resolve the problems it raises and 
?? vv good
inability to understand our capacity to reason
is just another philosophical SNAFU.
</p>



<p>
The objections 
<a href="https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/4826">2020 PhilPapers survey</a>
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives-reject the distinction between necessary and contingent truths as mistaken"><h4 id="reject the distinction between necessary and contingent truths as mistaken" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-three alternatives-reject the distinction between necessary and contingent truths as mistaken">reject the distinction between necessary and contingent truths as mistaken</a></h4></div>
<p>
The third and final option is to reject the distinction between necessary
and contingent truths altogether. This does not require To hold that there is a genuine distinction
between these truths that explains, among other things, why we can fairly
reliably sort statements into these categories, but that it has been
misdiagnosed as a distinction between necessary and contingent truths, and offer
a different account of how we are capable of 
</p>

<p>
????
The third and last option, is to reject the last remnants of the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning altogether. To reject the distinction between
necessary and contingent truths and in its place offer a different account of
the role these supposedly necessary truths, and necessarily truth preserving 
??
and how reasoning may justify our beliefs.
??
we need either an account of the justification of knowledge of necessary truths
or an account of why reasoning leads to truth that does not rely upon
knowledge of necessary truths
??
a lingering false remnant of a false theory
</p>

<p>
==============
the purpose of this essay is to defend??advocate??
</p>



<p>
we alone out of creation appear to be sensitive to reasons and not merely
causes. If no cause can play the role ascribed to reasons in that ancient
account of reasoning, then that ancient account is false.
</p>

<p>
necessary truths was a reversion to the ancient order.  Explaining our knowledge
of necessary truths, whether of mathematics, physics or biology, was the central
goal of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning. Not because the
ancient proponents of the traditional view thought the empirical justification
of knowledge of contingent truths was straightforward, but because they held
certain knowledge of necessary truths to be the only sort of knowledge worth
considering.
</p>

<div id="the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-not ia search for  foundations of our knowledge"><h2 id="not ia search for  foundations of our knowledge" class="header"><a href="#the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning-not ia search for  foundations of our knowledge">not ia search for  foundations of our knowledge</a></h2></div>

<p>
It is tempting, at this point, to suggest that the principles of reasoning are
bedrock. That no further justification is required. But what we are seeking is
not justification. No more than an account of the physical processes of the eye
increase confidence in our vision.  But rather we want an account of how
physical creatures such as ourselves can be sensitive to such justifications.
