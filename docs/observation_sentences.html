Quine's account of observation sentences fundamentally mis-represents the
connection between theories and their empirical contents via observation
sentences.

<p>
Observation
Quine makes many erroneous claims about holkiwm, and the connection of theories
with their empirical contents, but perhaps none are as devastating as the
problems with observation sentences.
</p>

<p>
Quine recognised the problem of inter-subjective identitiy of stimuli
</p>

<p>
Namely that the identification of observation sentences relies upon the
inter-subjective identification of stimuli. 
</p>


<p>
1st problem: 
</p>



<div id="overview"><h1 id="overview" class="header"><a href="#overview">overview</a></h1></div>
<p>
According to Quine empirical theories are connected with their con/infirmation 
conditions via observation sentences. There are however two fundamental defects
about Quine's account of observation sentences and how they provide this
connection.
</p>

<p>
The first concerns Quine's claim that the sentences providing this connection
must have fixed <q>stimulus meanings</q>. While this defect has never received
attention such rigid connections would preclude theories from being able to
issue testable predictionsit would, if consistently followed through, preclude
theories from having empirical content at all. On the other hand, once noted,
this defect is easily remedied and in that sense not a fundamental problem.
</p>

<p>
The second concerns intersubjective stimulus identity. The account of
<em>Word and Object</em> requires intersubjectively identical stimuli in order to
identify observation sentences, The body surface, or the impingements upon
sensory nerves, are not intersubjectively identifiable for the simple rerason
that different people have differently shaped (and weighted and sensitive)
bodies and different distributions of nerves.  Quine appears to have been well
aware of this problem and has issued several attempts ***
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of identifying the con/infirmation conditions preserved by good
translation the problem can be resolved by choosing a more distant, though
highly artificial <a href="epistemic_bottleneck.html">epistemic_bottleneck</a>. For the purpose of a schematic
account of how langauge is actually learnt and the kind of evidence that actual
language learners/teachers rely upon a somewhat more complex account of the
evidential basis for translation is required.

Occasionally I feel a deep anxiety that I will die before being able to explain
<a href="semantic_holism_trail.html">semantic_holism_trail</a> sufficiently clearly to do this beautiful semantic principle
justice. Of course, any philosopher worth their salt would be delighted to have
good reasons for believing a principle that is at once so clear, profound,
elegant, and (not least important) true, and yet so widely disbelieved.  After
all one of the chief joys of philosophy is the license it gives for largely
unsuccessful attempts to foist one's opinions on more or less innocent passers
by. The field is thus apt to attract those who enjoy the the painless suffering
of being a lone voice in the wilderness, and I am no exception.
</p>

<p>
It would, therefore, be disingenuous to count the fact that <a href="semantic_holism_trail.html">semantic_holism_trail</a>
and the accompanying doctrine of indeterminacy of translation are both widely
held to be either false, self-contradictory or incoherent as a tribulation for
those, like myself, who espouse the doctrine. 
What
does irritate somewhat, however, is that the very tools which critics use to
formulate their claims that semantic holism is incoherent or self-contradictory,
demonstrate the falsehood of their claims. For those tools provide beautifully
clear examples of semantic holism in action, and are produced by means which
exemplify the indeterminacy of translation. The computers and programs that
nearly all of us use to write our essays and articles provide perfectly clear
practical exemplars of both semantic and confirmation holism, and thereby
demonstrate the coherence of the very doctrines that the critics use them to
decry.

abstruse doctrines of the philosophy of langauge are vividly and concretely
true.

Why, <em>prima facie</em>, no practical examples are ??{to be expected}??
</p>

<p>
Let us begin by noting just how far fetched, it appears that any direct examples
of indeterminacy of translation will ever be produced in practice.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin, however, by emphasising just how far-fetched it seems  for
semantic holism implausible it seems that the doctrine of
confirmational holism (and thence semantic holism) and the under-determinacy of
translation is to have any direct and straightforward exemplars. Confirmation
holism is the doctrine that whole theories are the primary objects of
confimation (and infirmation) - and that some sentences (in perfectly good
linguistic standing) do not have confirmation (or infirmation) conditions at
all. If one holds that 
</p>

<p>
The connection between the two is widely supposed to be obscure and dubious, as
is each of the doctrines by themselves.

The same thing is wrong as with the following argument. Turing machines are not
of any greater complexity than DFA. A finite tape TM is = = DFA. Any computation
that is performed can be performed using only a finite amount of tape therefor
only a finite amount of tape is required
