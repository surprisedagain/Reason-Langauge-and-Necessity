Some proponents of a priori truth claim that there are two different kinds of a
priori truth. There are those that are "self-evident" in some sense.
<a href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html">Chisholm</a> calls these "axioms". They might be
called first principles, or perhaps fundamental principles. The second class of
a priori truths is derived from these. Both are true, necessary and knowable a
priori, but the statements of the second kind are not known as true just by
contemplating them, but rather because they can be deduced from those first
principle.
</p>

<p>
My claim is that this distinction is unexplained. Or rather that it is
unexplainable in terms of complexity, human ignorance, finitude etc., and that
the inability to explain this distinction is one of the reasons why the theory
of a priori truth is a bad one.
</p>


<p>
Fermat's last theorem example.
</p>


<p>
Why is it that we can lift some stones and not others? Because some are too
heavy 
</p>



<p>
: It's a problem for everyone, including empiricism. Some empirical truths are easier to know than others: it's easier to know that cats are furry than it is to know quantum mechanics; or it's easier to recognize triangles than 100 sided figures, and so on. Why is this supposed to be a problem just for rationalism is something I'm having a hard time to grasp (nor why do you dismiss the obvious explanations that I've given) 
37: It seems you want to say that it has to do with how easy to grasp the proposition is, but I think that's a shallow explanation. Now we want to ask why that affects what we can directly intuit and what we can't.
: Not just the proposition, rather it's because some facts are more complex than others (whether they are apriori or aposteriori) therefore it takes more work to get to know them
37: I think it's more of an issue for someone who thinks there's synthetic a priori knowledge that isn't conceptual knowledge or analytic in the broad sense. If all the truths are grasped through conceptual abilities, then we can just say that some are easier to grasp that way than others because they demand less of that ability. But if you think that a priori intuitions are spit out by some special faculty, there's no initial reason to expect that we'd be able to directly intuit some things but not others.
: Why can't the faculty for apriori knowledge be analogous to aposteriori perception? Both have their limitations.
37: It could be. The question is how.
: let me explain an important difference  - lovely to talk with you by the way.
</p>

<p>
I thought an obvious example might be - why can we lift some stones and not others.
Well, some stones are heavier than others. SOme stones are so heavy we cant lift them and some arent.
</p>

<p>
Well thats a very good explanation isnt it??
: But how can I tell a stone is heavy? well you can weigh it, and you can push on it, and you can measure your gravitational attraction towards it, and you can tie a big rope aroudn it and if the rope breaks when you pull on it its a pretty heavy rock.
: I don't know, but I don't see this as a decisive objection. Of course the apriori capacity of knowledge, if there were such a thing, would be a very mysterious thing, but if the rationalist is willing to bite the bullet here, then I don't see why this sort of problem should particularly worry him. The main challenge is to explain how could there be such a capacity in the first place
: But how else can I tell a "proposition" (/statement/inscription in a language - lets just say proposition but not make to big a deal out of it since I dont like those either) is "harder to know"
: Your "explanation" is a soporific virtue 
: How do we know a statement(/proposition) is complex? Well see if you can see if its true. If you can;'t then its complex. Why cant'I see that its true - because its complex.
</p>

<p>
How do you know the potion has soporific virtue - well it puts people to sleep doesnt it ??
: of course it has soporific virtue !!
: its relevant because (of course) I do have an explanation - but before you see how good my explanation is you need to start thinking(/worrying) that maybe an explanation is required 
: It's not complex because it's hard to grasp, I didn't say that was the criterion. We can give some other independent criterion, for example the number of terms contained in the propositions: for instance, propositions with 3 predicates vs 20 predicates. Perfectly analogous to the stone example.
: I think what particularly annoyed me was the idea that you could measure "complexity" in terms of length of the (shortest) proof for a given theorem
: ok so fermats last thoerem
: no X such that A<sup><small>x + b</small></sup>c = C^X with X &gt; 2
: one quantifier, two operations and an equality sign
: or what abotu the collatz conjecture?
: everyone who puts forward some philosophical theory has the burden to explain how it is supposed to work, but that's not an objection as such to any view
: there are some very simple claims for which there is no known proof
37: Well it does turn into an objection when the explanation is not forthcoming.
: Listen, I'm not trying to come up with a detailed explanation (I'm not a rationalist myself after all), I'm only saying that I don't see any reason why the rationalist would not be able to give an explanation in principle. I just don't see the argument
: yes it is an objection - "your"(/"the traditonal view") explanation of this phenomena is without value. Only taken seriously because it has historical tradition behind it, and this blinds us to how bad it is. becasue we are also trapped by first epistemology (we havent "naturalised" epistmeology) and there it seems like this is an essential requirement for all subsequent reasoning
: literally took me a few seconds to come up with a number of explanations
: so no one wonders abotu how this distinction is drawn - but assumes it is something we can take for granted (because after all, the other guy has to help herslf to this notion as well so nyah)
: and I'm not even a fan of the view
: Even if that's the case, that's still not a decisive objection against the view, unless you have an argument that could show that an explanation is impossible (something like the Benacerraf knowledge argument) 
: What would be a decisive objection against the view? I'm struggling to think of anything else.
: Well there are the other lacks in explanatory value.
: If the view could be shown to be incoherent or clashing with facts we know for certain to be true
: For sure.
: Im asking us to view it like any other scientific hypothesis. It is not enough for a scientific theory merely to be consistent.
: I think the rationalist can make the same claim wrt empiricism
: to which I can only suggest - go ahead
: but bear in mind this is not a political discussion ! Its not enough to just say - the other girl is just as bad as me !
: In that case we have to consider ALL the available arguments for and against both views, not just one
: If there is a problem in either direction then lets hear it
: But we can onyl consider them one at a time surely ??
: of course that's not what I meant
: who would you like to go first ??
: I think many people would say that platonism has easier time explaining mathematical/logical knowledge than empiricism
: unless you go full anti realist/non cognitivist
: I agree that it is in need of explanation.
: I'm just commenting on your lack of explanatory value objection
: that it's far from clear that it's the case
