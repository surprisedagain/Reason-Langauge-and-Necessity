Semantic holsim is a doctrine about the relationship between 
The principle that the primary bearers of meaning are whole theories and not
individual sentences.

<p>
The last and most influential philosophical movement held that the account of
meaning was intimately conencted with our knowledge of necessary truths. Holding
that these were true by virtue of meaning alone. For this reason alone it would
be worhtwhile to understand
</p>

<p>
but the belief in a deep connection bewteen these two fields/issues/areas goes
back to the oldest accounts of reasoning in the western tradition (see

## recap of Descartes concerns over under-determination
</p>

<p>
verificationism??
in some ways the earliest versions of verificationism are more restrictive that
even Descarets account.
For D claimed that
</p>

<p>
oldest best version: two statements are synonymous just in case they are
confirmed and infirmed by the same courses of experience.
</p>

<p>
the evidence for the truth of a claim exhausts the evidence available for
determining the meaning of that claim - there is a link here to deflationism
epistemic triangle
</p>

<p>
Even before we investigate the nature of the complexity of the connection
between evidence and the statements that are justified by that evidence there is
an important consequence of this verificationist principle.

The question is whether semantic holism
</p>
<blockquote>
SemHol is equivalent to the non-existence of an anlytic-synthetic
distinction //unsure if equivalence is right. are they interdeducible? Of
course the lack of such a sharp line is what the doctrine itself asserts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
argument agaist analytic
</blockquote>








<p>
How is it that our beliefs (i.e. the
things/states/whatever that reason is capable of justifying belief in) are
about the world at all? It seems that when we are justified in believing
we are justified in beliving it to be true, and it is true 
</p>

<p>
The argument for semantic holism takes as its premise is from confirmation
holism, principles concerning translation to <a href="verificationism.html">verificationism</a>.
</p>

<p>
From translation the key principle is:
</p>
<div id="sequence-meaning is whatever translation preserves"><h2 id="meaning is whatever translation preserves" class="header"><a href="#sequence-meaning is whatever translation preserves">meaning is whatever translation preserves</a></h2></div>
<p>
The principle that translation <span id="sequence-meaning is whatever translation preserves-ONLY"></span><strong id="ONLY">ONLY</strong> preserves confirmation conditions is based
upon the <a href="epistemic_triangle_of_language_learning.html">epistemic_triangle_of_language_learning</a> (i.e. that language
learners manage with only empirical evidence of the conditions under which
various sentences are held true/uttered/asserted by competent speakers.)

<p>
in order to reconcile semantic holism with fundamental principles guarding the
distribution of credence it appears one must accept
<a href="sum(P(t_given_e)_for_all_t)_must_be_over_1_for_some_e.html">sum(P(t_given_e)_for_all_t)_must_be_over_1_for_some_e.card</a>

principles of probability it appears one must accept that the truth conditions
of sentences depend upon which sentences one holds true, and that, in
turn, implies that the units of translation must be at least <span id="sequence-other related cards-sets"></span><strong id="sets">sets</strong> of sentences
held true and not individual sentences. (Which is at least tantamount to
holism.) In that somewhat curious, wordy, caveated, way - the two doctrines may
be said to be synonymous.

<p>
complexity of interactions implies HolisticConfirmation &rarr; slack in the system
and sum(P(theories) this slack manifests as strong underdetermination of theory
and underdetermination of translation
&rarr; unit of meaning is not the sentence &rarr; semanticholism

semhol  == slack in system, truth determined by
both internal use and external fact meeting in evidence

Truth aint just out there plus language. Out there + langauge + USE
