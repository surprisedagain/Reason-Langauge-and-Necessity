suppose that they whenever someone asserted a statement, i.e. whenever that
evidence obtained we could see the fact behind the scene. Whenever they say Gold
there is aome au23 (or whatever it is) in front of them.
</p>

<p>
But we also see that other evidence would prompt them to assert gold (i.e. they
their evidence is not sufficient to distingusih between gold and fool's gold.)
</p>

<p>
Suppose that tehrre was, in their environemnt, at least the whole of the
environemnt in which speakers of that language were found only gold and no fools
gold.
</p>

<p>
Suppose they expand from that region into a region where they come across fools
gold on a more or less regular basis. Ifr it seems significant maybe now more
than 50% of the stuff they suppose is gold (or talk about as) is fools gold, but
maybe its just 10% of the supposed gold that is fool's gold. In any case a
significant proportion (though not necessarily evenly distributed) of the
suppsed gold make it more than 50% if you think its important ????
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that they gain access to evidence which allows them to distinguish
gold from fools gold. Maybe they build a spectroscope or some special piece of
machinery that gioves them access to experimental results that they could not
previously obtain. Maybe they get access to the neighbouring valley and can look
at the relevant mountain from the other side. 
</p>

<p>
And they decide to keep the term to describe both types of object. Here we have
something like Putnam's Jade case.
</p>


<p>
Let us vary the order of events somewhat, suppose again that we have a
culture/community/tribe which cannot distinguish between gold and fools gold and
applies the same term to both. And again they live in a region where although
fool's gold is, as they like to say, nomologically possible, none actually
occurs. Again all the stuff these people call gold is actually gold1. Now they
develop the ability to distinguish between gold1 and fools gold.
</p>

<p>
It may be that distinguishing between these two was not part of the motivation
for developing the techniques/apparatus/whatever it was that enabled them to
acquire the evidence distinguishing between gold1 and gold2. They had no idea
that gold2 existed (though it might have been something, like dark matter today,
whose existence they suspected but had not been able to verify).
</p>

<p>
Now, subsequently to developing the ability to distinguish gold1 (which they
continue to call gold) and gold2 (which they call dark gold) they expand into a
different region or somehow come across some gold2 for the first time.
