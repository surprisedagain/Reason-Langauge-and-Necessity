<p>
Once upon a time, long long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us
to truth. Our minds contained concepts, and these concepts were either the very
same as the properties of the objects around us or at least very similar to
them. (Perhaps in something like the way that an object and its impression in a
clay tablet are similar.) Maybe these concepts were imprinted in our minds
through our senses, or maybe they were perfect forms of which physical
properties were imperfect copies. But in either case there was a consonance
between our concepts and the properties of the objects around us.  The heat felt
when touching a flame was thought to be similar to the heat which causes the
flame to burn, the weight felt when lifting a stone similar to the weight in the
stone which caused it to resist being pushed, and the color one sees when
looking at a white patch of snow similar to the whiteness of the snow.  Because
of these more or less direct encounters with object's properties we could intuit
the fundamental general principles governing them. 
</p>

<p>
A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the objects around us
(i.e. discern God's ineffable plan)<span class='tooltip'>*<span class='tooltiptext'>Leibniz is perhaps the last influential exponent of this claim.</span></span>.
Even limited intellects such as our own, however, could determine which
combinations of properties were possible or impossible by examining which
combinations of concepts we could conceive of "clearly and distinctly" (in
Descartes' famous phrase).  Objects that could not be conceived, such as round
squares, or triangles whose internal angles did not sum to two right angles,
were impossible.
</p>

<p>
The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume), was geometry.
Geometry taken, not as we now understand it, as an investigation into various
non-physical mathematical idealisations, but as the ancients understood it, an
investigation into the structure of the physical space through which our bodies
move. Geometry was the exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was
taken to show that reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles
imprinted in us by experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and
observation, could produce substantial knowledge of the structure of the world.
There were, of course, famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the
fallibility of the senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that
our justifications for beliefs about the external world did not reach the
standard set by geometry.  Rather than challenging the classical theory of
knowledge, the ancient skeptics simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.
</p>

<p>
In the European intellectual tradition, philosophers began to note the cracks
heralding the long, unstoppable, collapse of these accounts of reason and
knowledge shortly before AD 1650. It is, of course, impossible to put a precise
date upon when the collapse began or ended.  At first, awareness of the problems
that led to the collapse spread piecemeal, and when they were noted they did not
immediately give rise to despair, but rather to various attempts to repair or
resolve these issues.  The death-knell of the ancient account of reasoning might
reasonably be said to have been struck in 1915 with Einstein's discovery that
physical space was not Euclidean. But some thinkers had abandoned hope in the
old scheme long before this, while others continued to hold faith in it even
after this point (indeed some still do, at least unwittingly - <a href="introduction_for_the_complete_beginner.html#What counts as knowledge? What counts a reasoning?">see below</a>).
</p>

<p>
The key factor that caused this collapse, was the undeniable growth in
scientific knowledge.  This growth posed two distinct and fundamental problems
for the traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning.
</p>

<div id="main-justification of scientific theories"><h2 id="justification of scientific theories" class="header"><a href="#main-justification of scientific theories">justification of scientific theories</a></h2></div>
<p>
The first problem concerned the justification of scientific knowledge.  While
the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor known
with the same certainty as geometrical principles (e.g. the principle that
just one straight line passes through any two distinct points), it was not
preposterous to cast the principles of physics as like geometrical principles
in being necessarily true first principles known with greater certainty that
the observable consequences that could be derived from them, and made true by the
essential natures of the relevant objects and properties. The Aristotelian
principle that heat rises, for instance, is on this view not an empirical
generalisation, but an essential aspect of the nature of heat that may be
grasped, by a mind capable of contemplating general laws, in a flash of
cognition after repeatedly observing hot objects. The new scientific laws,
however, could not be made to fit into this mold.
</p>

<div id="main-justification of scientific theories-insensible properties"><h3 id="insensible properties" class="header"><a href="#main-justification of scientific theories-insensible properties">insensible properties</a></h3></div>
<p>
At every point, the fundamental generalisations that form the core of
scientific theories are unlike necessary truths grasped with certainty in a
flash of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant
properties. To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in those
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  Properties such as charge, field
strength and spin, by contrast, cannot be sensed by humans at all. Even
properties such as wavelength and mass which might be thought to be sensible,
were applied in ways foreign to our ordinary sensations.  The mass of an object,
for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is dependent upon
gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras the former
remains constant.
</p>

<div id="main-justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths"><h3 id="not necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#main-justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths">not necessary truths</a></h3></div>
<p>
The next difference is that scientific generalisations are not true necessarily.
Perhaps the most influential exponent of this fact is
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/">Popper<sup>ext</sup></a>, who proclaimed
<span id="main-justification of scientific theories-not necessary truths-falsifiability"></span><strong id="falsifiability">falsifiability</strong> to be the hallmark of scientific claims. According to Popper, a
general statement is falsifiable if and only if there is a possible "basic
statement" (i.e. a singular existential claim, such as "the needle on the
voltmeter is pointing to 11") whose truth is "intersubjectively testable" (i.e.
about which observers can come to agreement despite other differences in their
beliefs) which is incompatible with that general statement. But of course, a
necessary truth is true regardless of the truth of falsehood of any such "basic
statement", and hence not scientific by Popper's standard.
</p>

<div id="main-justification of scientific theories-nor known with certainty"><h3 id="nor known with certainty" class="header"><a href="#main-justification of scientific theories-nor known with certainty">nor known with certainty</a></h3></div>
<p>
While Popper formulated his <em>falsification principle</em> in the mid 20th
century, Descartes had already recognised that scientific claims gained
credence via their success in predicting experimental results (and other
observations) by 1650.  For several centuries afterwards, it was only dimly
apprehended<span class='tooltip'>*<span class='tooltiptext'>by everyone apart, perhaps, from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes">Reverend Bayes<sup>ext</sup></a></span></span>
that for an experience to give creedence to any hypothesis, there must be other
possible experiences which would confute it (hence Popper's emphasis on
falsification); but it <span id="main-justification of scientific theories-nor known with certainty-was"></span><strong id="was">was</strong> widely understood that belief in scientific
generalisations was justified by the experimental results
(and other observable phenomena) that they predicted, and that <em><span id="main-justification of scientific theories-nor known with certainty-they were not deducible from"></span><strong id="they were not deducible from">they were not deducible from</strong></em>
(descriptions of) those results.
</p>

<p>
There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10, and secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
gu=arantee the truth of the scientific principles

<p>
scientific laws are known with less certainty than
the instances of particualr objects fulfilling them. Geometical and arithemetic
laws, are known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they
subsume. The observation of litmus paper turning red is more certain than the
general law that litmus paper turns red when in contact with an acid.

which views scientific theories rather than geometical theorems as the
paradigmatic exemplars of knowledge, the fundamental generalizations

????- CLEAR NOT FIRST PRINCIPLES - DESCARTES
For all these reasons it is abundantly clear that scientific laws are neither
neccesarily true first principles nor deduced from such principles. Descartes
was first and foremost among those who noted that and his first response was to
attempt to reconcile. In his Meditations he proposed to <em>deduce</em> the existence
of God from his famous <a href="cogito.html">cogito ergo sum</a>, and thence to deduce that the
the clear and distinct hypotheses that came to human minds to predict and
systematise thewir observations must be true, since God would not deceive us;
thus he proposed to reconcile 
</p>

<p>
Descrates was perhaps the first, and certainly the foremost, of those 
who recognised that scientific generalisations were not deductive consequences
of the observations that gave them credence. His response was not to proppose any
modification of the traditional accounts but rather to explain away the
indeducibility of scientific theories from certain first principles as a mere
appearance. 
</p>

<p>
His '<a href="cogito ergo sum.html">cogito ergo sum</a>', was supposed to be a first
principle form which, with God's grace, all science could be derived.
For if the existence of a beneficent God could be proven, then

<p>
God would not be so deceitful as to place in our minds principles which
perfectly predicted our observations but were yet false. In this way he hoped to
show that scientific laws were deducible from first principles (most importantly

It might be thought that this is all old news, that the collapse we are
describing is simply the scientific revolution described from the losing
side. and that the methods of philosophy were simply superseded by those of
science.
</p>

<p>
But its that the revolution did not go deep enough.
</p>

<p>
Belief in the scientific method, is itself a kind of a projection of the old scheme onto
new materials. The hope that there might be some principles of so-called
abductive or inductive reasoning, rules for deriving general formulas from
finite observations; rules as clearly and definitely describable as the princples
of classical deductive logic but justifying less than absolute certainrty in
their conclusions.

more plausibly) had overlooked that importance of assiduously pursuing
observations that would falsify our theories. While both these things are

GOOD
The second problem concerned the content of the new knowledge.
The developing scientific theories concerning the
processes giving rise to experience, directly contradicted the traditional
claims upon which the old accounts of reason and knowledge relied. The new
understanding of the physical, chemical and physiological process underlying
perception, made it clear that what was going on at the surface of well lit
objects was wildly different to the streams of particles or waves that traveled
from those surfaces to our eyes, which was wildly different to the
electro-chemical reactions in our retina, which was wildly different again to
the electrical signals that traveled from those retina to our brains. Hume went
so far as to consider the mental processes of thinking and sensing themselves to
be mechanical processes and hence subject to faults like all other mechanisms;
but even if the eventual sensations that these processes led up to were in
non-physical minds, the illusion that our minds had anything remotely
describable as direct contact with the properties of the objects around us was
irretrievably shattered. For a while, it was thought that the old account might
yet be true of knowledge of one's own psychological states, and hope remained
that mental objects might be known with the same certainty and directness that
had been attributed to our knowledge of the properties (if not the objects)
presented in our sensations of the external world. One effect of this was a
lingering sense that philosophy was more closely connected to psychology than to
other sciences. But even this remaining illusion largely collapsed in the face
of Freud's theories which (even if they were wildly wrong) made it plausible
that our knowledge of many of our own mental states was fallible; and
Wittgenstein's suggestions that ascriptions of mental states were justified not
by private experiences but rather by public behaviour.
</p>

but the very
success of those theories made denying their status as knowledge increasingly
untenable. Where ancient skeptics had been prepared to denounce all judgement

can intuitively discern necessary connections). That the classical account of
deductive reasoning was corrrect as far as it went, but that it left out the
basis for empiical investigation.

Now it is not even true that the ancient logical systems were adequate, but even
if we grant deductive (classical) logic in its entirety as a ancient
development (purely for the sake of a historical argument) the account of what.

In this collection of notes (and at the end of this trail) we come to a definite
conclusion.

<p>
Someone who has survived a modern day university arts course, or engaged with
almost any of the academic humanities as they are currently practised, may
naturally suspect that any enquiry into the nature of knowledege and reasoning
must begin by defining its terms, and that those definitions will largely
pre-determine what account we eventually arrive at regarding the nature of
reasoning and knowledge.  That, to put in its crudest form, "It all depends on
what you mean by 'knoweldge' and 'reasoning'".  This view however, is itself a
remnant of the ancient view outlined above, according to which the only way to
arrive at knowledge is by starting with certain principles (reflecting either
the essential properties of objects or our definitions or perhaps both) and then
derive consequences from them. The fact that such approaches are still often
regarded as the pre-eminent method of conducting an intellectual investigation
is both a sign of how the ancient view lingers on in the humanities departments
of academia, and how bankrupt those departments have (often) become.
</p>

<p>
The approach followed here is more akin to an investigation into a new and
only partly understaood observed phenomena.  Rather than starting with
definitions we shall begin with exemplars and search for any underlying
principles that might explain or unite them. 
</p>

Like the ancients Geometry, the giving of proofs concerning the relative length
of lines, closed figures consisting of such lines and the size of circles and
angles. The proof by which each of us is genuinely convinced that the area of
the square based upon the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the
sum of the reas of the squares based on its other two sides(and not merely brow
beaten into acquiesing with this claim). The argument Socrates presents to the
slave boy in the <a href="Meno.html">Meno</a> oldest exemplar of this kind of
reasoning (in any tradition <span class='tooltip'>*<span class='tooltiptext'>While mathematicians in both China and the Indus

These must all count as reasoning, and
the claims issued must in some sense count as true.
</p>

<p>
Whatever is going in these exemplars had better count as
reasoning.
</p>

<p>
The attitude I am proposing to follow can be couched as a form of
humility. If our philosophical account of reasoning implies that any of the
cases above are not instances of reasoning, or that they do not lead us to
gain justified true beliefs about the world or that those beliefs are not
knwoledge; then it is more likely that our account of knowlege and reasoning is
wrong rather than those cases not being knowledge. Rather than collapsing into
scepticism if the account of reasoning we uncover does not fit our
preconceptions, let us take our amazing success in producing knowledge in
geometry, mathematics, science and everyday life as more certain than any
philosopher's crazy theory.
