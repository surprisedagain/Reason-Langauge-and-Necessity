The principle that language learners <span id="epistemic triangle of language learning-short--ONLY"></span><strong id="ONLY">ONLY</strong> require either:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
epistemic access to the epistemic conditions(/epistemically accessible
    evidence) under which competent speakers hold statements to be true/false
    and (some) competent speaker's verdicts on those statements<br>
    <span id="epistemic triangle of language learning-short--OR"></span><strong id="OR">OR</strong><br>

<li>
The teacher to have epistemic access to the evidence Competent speakers to have epistemic access to the learners accessible

</ol>

in order to become competent speakers themselves.
</blockquote>

<div id="main"><h1 id="main" class="header"><a href="#main">main</a></h1></div>
<p>
This principle is the fundamental justification of verificationism.
</p>

<p>
The principle can be restated in terms of sufficient conditions
</p>

<p>
In Quine's writing it is presented as an epistemic triangle.
</p>

<p>
In principle separable from empiricism. We might admit among the basic evidence
which confirms(/infirms) our confirmable semantic objects (be they words,
sentences or theories) intuitions, divine revelations and/or 
</p>


<p>
Quine often appears to further justify this principle on grounds of
behaviourism. In ??{ontological relativity}??, for example, he further
attributes this linguistic behaviourism to Dewey and directly draws
considerations about the limits on semantic properties and relationships:
	(p.29) When on the other hand we recognise with Dewey that "meaning . . . is
	primarily a property of behaviour," we recognise that there are no meanings,
	nor likenesses nor distinctions of meaning, beyond what are implicit in
	people's dispositions to overt behaviour.
Now, holding true is supposed to be cashed out as being disposed to affirm when
questioned, and that is a "disposition to overt behaviour" in good standing.
Hence a commitment to epistemic triangles as sufficient
if you grant the langauge learner access to the overt behaviour of
teacher/exemplar/pre-existing competent speakers
</p>

<p>
this becomes the chief (sole?)
focus in ??{word and object}??.

One might suppsoe that the student could learn a langauge if they could see for
themselves the conditions that obtained on the far side of the relevant

teacher(s) held true. They might not have access to the teachers epistemic
