This is not in any sense intended to refute skepticism or to show 
Suppose that people actually believed that there was a deceitful demon etc., Now
surely is skepticism has to be the sort of thing that people can actually
beleive if it is to be threatening at all. If it turns out to be impossible to
believe that the possible alternatives which the skeptic uses, then sxcepticism
is a whole lot less threatening. Indeed, If out of all the epistemically
indistinguishable alternatives there were just one that it was possible for us
to believe that would seems like it could be parlayed into reason for holding
that sole believable theory to be true. (That was, after all, the Kantian plan.)

alternatives. i.e. instaed of believing that

Now suppose further that we have the two groups seperate from each other enough
that lseparare langauge evolution occurs, and homophonic translation between the
two fails. Or we could simply suppose that the two groups simply spoke different
languages from the outset, but that one of these groups beleives (whether we can
tell it or not) in a skeptical alternative.

since this time every major milestone in philosophy has been an attempt to
bridge the gap, and explain our capacity to reason and the apparent knowledge
(perhaps implicit) of necessary truths upon which that capacity appears to
depend.
