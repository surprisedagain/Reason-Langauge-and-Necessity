<p>
A range of philosophical problems are created by treating belief as binary
rather than a matter of degree.
</p>



<div id="main"><h1 id="main" class="header"><a href="#main">main</a></h1></div>
<p>
It is often tempting to suppose that one can reduce talk of believing to talk
of  believing with 
Treating belief as binary leads to many of the same difficulties as drawing a
binary division 
</p>

<div id="main-the lottery paradox"><h2 id="the lottery paradox" class="header"><a href="#main-the lottery paradox">the lottery paradox</a></h2></div>
<p>
suppose that there is a lottery with 1000. And suppose we set a level of
confidence less than absolute confidence
</p>


<div id="belief"><h1 id="belief" class="header"><a href="#belief">belief</a></h1></div>
<p>
much the same problems as are raised by the lottery paradox with regard to
knowledge re-occur with belief.
</p>

<p>
beleive that 1 will lose, believe that 2 will lose, beleive that 3 will lose . . .
. but believe that one of 1, 2, 3, 4 will win (and that each player will either
win or lose but not both)
</p>

<p>
There is a vast difference between saying that something is false and saying
that something has a 30% chance of being true.  Nate de silver (???? 538) gave
Trump a 38% chance of winnign the 20?? american presidential election. When
asked about "getting things so wrong" he replied that "things that have a 38%
chance of happening happen about 38% of the time."

<p>
The above considerations might lead some to dispense with sentences of the form
"X believes Y" in favour of "X believes Y with credence P" (or perhaps "credence
greater than P" if one doubts that one could attach precise probabilities to all
of peoples ordinary beleifs).
</p>

<p>
I applaud those who propose such a wholesale rejection of "X believes Y". I draw
their attention to the fact that they have found their way to exemplifying
Quine's double standardhave found their way to exemplifying Quine's double
standard.
For they hold that 
</p>

<p>
X believes Y not acceptable in rigorous theories,
not necessarily avoided in ordinary speech
there is no reduction proposed between the two.
everything is fine, no reason to doubt the truth of either.
</p>

<p>
it seems that we could do justice to this vagueness in our new speech after all
"X believes Y with a quite high degree of confidence" where just what counts as
quite high is deliberately left vague. (on par with `beliving Y
beyond reasonable doubt)
<span id="belief-broader moral-unresolved"></span><span class="tag" id="unresolved">unresolved</span>
is this an acceptable reduction after all??
</p>

<p>
their reasons for rejecting "X believes Y" would be reinstated if we had reasons
for rejecting vagueness from our most rigourous scientific theories.
