Kant is perhaps the most influential famous exponent of this claim:
</p>
<blockquote>
What matters here is that we find a characteristic by which we can safely
distinguish a pure cognition from empirical ones. Now, experience does
indeed teach us that something is thus or thus, but not that it cannot be
otherwise. First, then, if we find a proposition such that in thinking it
we think at the same time its necessity, then it is an a priori judgment;
&hellip;
Second, experience never provides its judgments with true or strict
universality, but only (through induction) with assumed and comparative
universality; hence [there] we should, properly speaking, say [merely] that
as far as we have observed until now, no exception is to be found to this or
that rule. If, thereÂ­ fore, a judgment is thought with strict universality,
i.e., thought in such a way that no exception whatever is allowed as
possible, then the judgment is not derived from experience, but is valid
absolutely a priori.  Hence empirical universality is only [the result of]
our choosing to upgrade validity from one that holds in most cases to
one that holds in all, as, e.g., in the proposition, All bodies have weight.
But when universality is strict and belongs to a judgment essentially, then
it points to a special cognitive source for the judgment, viz., a power of a
priori cognition. Hence necessity and strict universality are safe
indicators of a priori cognition, and they do moreover belong together
inseparably.<br>

but he takes it to be so fundamental
</p>

<p>
The claim that experience can never justify believing a truth to be necessary is
a commonplace among philosophers from the beginning of the modern period.
</p>

<p>
Although the guiding motivation of Descartes' <a href="cogito.html">cogito</a> is to establish that
all our scientific knowledge can be <em>deduced</em> from certain first principles
(including the principle <em>I exist</em> which is the sole fundamental non-necessary
principle which we can know with certainty). Descartes' 
It is implicit in Descartes
</p>



<p>
But it is so fundamental that he does not so much argue for the claim

This is often set as a traditional problem for empiricism:

experience is fallible
hmm precludes certainty, but doesw necessity require certainty

as hume showed conclusively ???
from langauge truth an logic but find original in treatise or enquiry??
