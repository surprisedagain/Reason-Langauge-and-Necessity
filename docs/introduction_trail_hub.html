This work is devoted to the following question:
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<th>
What is reasoning, that creatures such as us can do it?

Our enquiry begins by considering previous answers to this question and
attempting to understand why they are unsatisfactory.

Giving a precise account of the fundamental grounds for the failure of the most
recent influential account of our knowledge of necessary truths requires an
explication and defence of the controversial doctrines of confirmation holism
and semantic holism.

This is the reason for supposing that the content of our belief is empirical -
that we can read any two systems into the world. And it is not the case that one
is wrong and the other is right - if we do not then we do not have knowledge of
the external world.

Kant - to perceive is not merely some blob of color/sound a wild mishmash of
sensation. When we are <q>perceiving</q> we are running our non-linguistic
representation. We impose our structure, but that does not guarantee that that
structure is correct, nor can such a structure really be imposed at all

always relative to a range. How is it that we <q>Mrs bennett</q> like
              always revise our attributions of knowledge when the relevant
              belief turns out to be wrong. Give the same evidence, very trong,
              we take the person as havign knowledge. Then afterwards we reqrite
              our judgement, as though they did domething wrong/imporoper after
              all.

<li>
knowledge is a result that is formed by a process that in a safe
              space around the real world is safe/sensitive.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
When I claim to knowledge i claim that in a sufficiently large sphere of
possible worlds around the real world, my belief in sensitive to the truth.

This circle has to be large enough to include some cases where the claim is
false.

“George knows that he has hands, but he doesn’t know that he’s not the handless
victim of a Cartesian demon”
</p>

<p>
But George does not know that he has hands and he's not a Cartesian victim.
</p>

<p>
That we do not like to admit this is that once we open up the scope we do not
like to admit that we adopt any other. We are alwasy right about the scope of
possibilities, and it is so wide that we could not be wrong.
