This work is devoted to the following question:
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<th>
What is reasoning, that creatures such as us can do it?

Our enquiry begins by considering previous answers to this question and
attempting to understand why they are unsatisfactory.

Giving a precise account of the fundamental grounds for the failure of the most
recent influential account of our knowledge of necessary truths requires an
explication and defence of the controversial doctrines of confirmation holism
and semantic holism.
