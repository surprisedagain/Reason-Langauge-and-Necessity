What is the relationship between . Given knowledge of the objects <em>in</em> the

   this does not decide internalism/externalism. If we are in this situation
   what can we know of the objects that are on the far side of the relevant
   epistemic bottleneck. The first obvious question is under what circumstances
   can we know or are we justified in believing that anything is on the far side
   of an epistemic bottleneck at all?

positivism - the answer of positivism is that we cant. Given only

          objects on the far side and having no contact with the properties of
          those objects except through these intermediaries, we can have no

      let us talk about the patterns on the screen. Since this is all we know,
      there must be something about these patterns that justifies our knowledge
      of the objects on the far side.
      Since we are not skeptics we . ON the assumption that we do have
      knowledge. The anti-empiricist, insists in a sense that there never
      are pure epistemic bottlenecks. That we always have some knowledge of the

      objects and hence there are other sources of knowledge .

is wrong and the other is right - if we do not then we do not have knowledge of

representation. We impose our structure, but that does not guarantee that that
structure is correct, nor can such a structure really be imposed at all

reasoning - the interplay between two forms of representation
dretske analog and digital
</p>
<blockquote>
I will say that a signal (structure, event, state) carries the information
that s is F in digital form if and only if the signal carries no additional
information about s, no information that is not already nested in s’s being
F.  If the signal does carry additional information about s, information
that is not nested in s’s being F, then I shall say that the signal carries
this information in analog form. When a signal carries the information that
s is F in analog form, the signal always carries more specific, more
determinate, information about s than that it is F.22
