How is it that philosophers are so damn dogmatic when none of them agree?
</p>

<p>

<div id="main-the problem"><h2 id="the problem" class="header"><a href="#main-the problem">the problem</a></h2></div>
<p>
the problem is simple. all these philsoophers are so damn confident. So sure that
reason dictates that their theories are correct, and yet they all disagree with
each other.
</p>

<p>
surely this casts doubt on philosophers claims. For the non-philosopher it seems
that no philosopher is rightly . If there were good reasons

The principle that

assures us that two philosophers may each be justified in confidently (at least
&gt;50%) holding incompatible theories true. And the "slack" that gives rise to
this the justification of such excessive confidence
</p>

<p>
theories 
but this only explains a fraction of the excessivwe confidence with which
philosophers hold their theories.
</p>

<p>
but even if different philosophers may be more confident with this there is
still an excess of confidence to be explained.
</p>

<p>
NO doubt there <em>is</em> a great deal of irrationality among philosphers.
attraction of never being proven wrong
remoteness from observation
