Occasionally I feel a deep anxiety that I will die before being able to explain
<a href="semantic_holism.html">semantic_holism</a> sufficiently clearly to do this beautiful semantic principle
justice. Of course, any philosopher worth their salt would be delighted to have
good reasons for believing a principle that is at once so clear, profound,
elegant, and (not least important) true, and yet so widely disbelieved.  After
all one of the chief joys of philosophy is the license it gives for largely
unsuccessful attempts to foist one's opinions on more or less innocent passers
by. The field is thus apt to attract those who enjoy the the painless suffering
of being a lone voice in the wilderness, and I am no exception.

It would, therefore, be disingenuous to count the fact that <a href="semantic_holism.html">semantic_holism</a>
and the accompanying doctrine of indeterminacy of translation are both widely
held to be either false, self-contradictory or incoherent as a tribulation for
those, like myself, who espouse the doctrine. 
What
does irritate somewhat, however, is that the very tools which critics use to
formulate their claims that semantic holism is incoherent or self-contradictory,
demonstrate the falsehood of their claims. For those tools provide beautifully
clear examples of semantic holism in action, and are produced by means which
exemplify the indeterminacy of translation. The computers and programs that
nearly all of us use to write our essays and articles provide perfectly clear
practical exemplars of both semantic and confirmation holism, and thereby
demonstrate the coherence of the very doctrines that the critics use them to
decry.

abstruse doctrines of the philosophy of langauge are vividly and concretely
true.

<p>
Let us begin by noting just how far fetched, it appears that any direct examples
of indeterminacy of translation will ever be produced in practice.

<p>
Let us begin, however, by emphasising just how far-fetched it seems  for
semantic holism implausible it seems that the doctrine of
confirmational holism (and thence semantic holism) and the under-determinacy of
translation is to have any direct and straightforward exemplars. Confirmation
holism is the doctrine that whole theories are the primary objects of
confimation (and infirmation) - and that some sentences (in perfectly good
linguistic standing) do not have confirmation (or infirmation) conditions at
all. If one holds that

<p>
The connection between the two is widely supposed to be obscure and dubious, as
is each of the doctrines by themselves.

The same thing is wrong as with the following argument. Turing machines are not
of any greater complexity than DFA. A finite tape TM is = = DFA. Any computation
that is performed can be performed using only a finite amount of tape therefor
only a finite amount of tape is required

What reason do we have for postulating external objects. For what we are

expectation. It may is possible that the term is . One of the chief indicators
of expectation is that a failure of expectations causes a chengce in subsequent
expectations. So long as things go the way you expect, the way you expect things
to go doesn't change much. Its when one unexpectedly runs into a table in the
dark (or the spanish inquisisition) that ones expectations change.

<p>
One of the complaints commonly voiced against indeterminacy of translation is
that it is simply a rehashed form of Cartesian skepticism. (Which is, it is
tacitly suggested, a disorder we all recovered from in 2nd year courses in
epistemology.)
