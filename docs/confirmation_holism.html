Confirmation holism is the doctrine that the objects con/infirmed by evidence
are whole theories.

The seems to be widespread confusion over just what confirmation holism is, and
even those who argue that the doctrine is confused, self-contradictory or
incoherent. For that reaosn let us begin

Since then it apears to have fallen on hard times. It is not so much
discredited but as unclear. Furthermore it is also unclear how this is supposed
to suuport the various radical conseuences such as the indeterminacy of

It may be objected at this point that confirmation holism is true

<p>
It would, therefore, be disingenuous to count the fact that <a href="semantic_holism_trail.html">semantic_holism_trail</a>
and the accompanying doctrine of indeterminacy of translation are both widely
held to be either false, self-contradictory or incoherent as a tribulation for
those, like myself, who espouse the doctrine. 
What
does irritate somewhat, however, is that the very tools which critics use to
formulate their claims that semantic holism is incoherent or self-contradictory,
demonstrate the falsehood of their claims. For those tools provide beautifully
clear examples of semantic holism in action, and are produced by means which
exemplify the indeterminacy of translation. The computers and programs that
nearly all of us use to write our essays and articles provide perfectly clear
practical exemplars of both semantic and confirmation holism, and thereby
demonstrate the coherence of the very doctrines that the critics use them to
decry.

<p>
Let us begin by noting just how far fetched, it appears that any direct examples
of indeterminacy of translation will ever be produced in practice.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin, however, by emphasising just how far-fetched it seems  for
semantic holism implausible it seems that the doctrine of
confirmational holism (and thence semantic holism) and the under-determinacy of
translation is to have any direct and straightforward exemplars. Confirmation
holism is the doctrine that whole theories are the primary objects of
confimation (and infirmation) - and that some sentences (in perfectly good
linguistic standing) do not have confirmation (or infirmation) conditions at
all. If one holds that

<p>
not only is confirmation holism exemplified by computer programming languages,
but so too are many of the supposed controvertial consequences, whose connection
with confirmation holism is so doubted by many philosphers (there is no argument
from confirmation holism to indeterminacy of translation or the lack of an
analyrtic synthetic distinction).

The same thing is wrong as with the following argument. Turing machines are not
of any greater complexity than DFA. A finite tape TM is = = DFA. Any computation
that is performed can be performed using only a finite amount of tape therefor
only a finite amount of tape is required

of expectation is that a failure of expectations causes a chengce in subsequent
expectations. So long as things go the way you expect, the way you expect things
to go doesn't change much. Its when one unexpectedly runs into a table in the
dark (or the spanish inquisisition) that ones expectations change.
