<p>
Confirmation holism is a thesis about the types of things that are related to
each other by the relationship of confirmation.
</p>







<div id="confirmation holism-assumptions"><h3 id="assumptions" class="header"><a href="#confirmation holism-assumptions">assumptions</a></h3></div>
<p>
Confirmation is a relationship between at least two entities. On one side of this
relationship is the entity that is confirmed, and on the other side is the
entity that confirms it.
</p>

<p>
Although there are at least two entities involved instance of confirmation, we
are not assuming that it is just two entities that are thus related. It may be
that an entity is only confirmed relative to, say, background assumptions, or
prior beliefs, in which case those background assumptions also enter into the
relationship of confirmation. It may also be the case that entities are only
confirmed to degrees and that those degrees are also involved in the
relationship of confirmation. In any case confirmation is a relationship between
(at least) entities that are confirmed and the entities that confirm them.
</p>

<p>
The things that are confirmed are representations, things that can be true or
false,
</p>

<p>
for if an entity is confirmed then we are justified in believing it to be
true (to whatever degree, and relative to whatever background assumptions or
other relata it is confirmed). Sentences, beliefs, theories and other forms of
representation are among the <em>prima facie</em> candidates for confirmation
</p>

<p>
depending on whether or not the things they represent are as they
represent them to be. Sentences, beliefs, theories and perhaps other forms of representation 
</p>

<p>
If they are confirmed then we are justified, or perhaps only justified to a
greater degree, in believing it to be true, i.e. that the things they represent
are as they represent them to be.

something may be confirmed

even those who argue that the doctrine is confused, self-contradictory or
incoherent. For that reaosn let us begin

Since then it appears to have fallen on hard times. It is not so much
discredited but as unclear. Furthermore it is also unclear how this is
supposed to support the various radical consequences such as the

It may be objected at this point that confirmation holism is true

<p>
It would, therefore, be disingenuous to count the fact that <a href="semantic_holism_trail.html">semantic_holism_trail</a>
and the accompanying doctrine of indeterminacy of translation are both widely
held to be either false, self-contradictory or incoherent as a tribulation for
those, like myself, who espouse the doctrine. 
What
does irritate somewhat, however, is that the very tools which critics use to
formulate their claims that semantic holism is incoherent or self-contradictory,
demonstrate the falsehood of their claims. For those tools provide beautifully
clear examples of semantic holism in action, and are produced by means which
exemplify the indeterminacy of translation. The computers and programs that
nearly all of us use to write our essays and articles provide perfectly clear
practical exemplars of both semantic and confirmation holism, and thereby
demonstrate the coherence of the very doctrines that the critics use them to
decry.

<p>
Let us begin by noting just how far fetched, it appears that any direct examples
of indeterminacy of translation will ever be produced in practice.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin, however, by emphasising just how far-fetched it seems  for
semantic holism implausible it seems that the doctrine of
confirmational holism (and thence semantic holism) and the under-determinacy of
translation is to have any direct and straightforward exemplars. Confirmation
holism is the doctrine that whole theories are the primary objects of
confimation (and infirmation) - and that some sentences (in perfectly good
linguistic standing) do not have confirmation (or infirmation) conditions at
all. If one holds that

not only is confirmation holism exemplified by computer programming languages,
but so too are many of the supposed controvertial consequences, whose connection
with confirmation holism is so doubted by many philosphers (there is no argument
from confirmation holism to indeterminacy of translation or the lack of an
analyrtic synthetic distinction).

The same thing is wrong as with the following argument. Turing machines are not
of any greater complexity than DFA. A finite tape TM is = = DFA. Any computation
that is performed can be performed using only a finite amount of tape therefor
only a finite amount of tape is required

=========
If you think of observational content as a kind of content, and you want to
provide an account of language according to which different people speak the
same language then you will want an account according to which different people
can assert sentences (observational ones) with the <em>same</em> content. You want an
intersubjective standard of observational content. This is perhaps the
motivation behind Quine's proposed distinction between highly observational.
