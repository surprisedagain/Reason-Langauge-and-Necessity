the argument for defaltionary:
if tehre weere some ther evidence available to determine some substantial
relationship that must exist between a form of words and thye facst thyat make
it true, then we could examine that form of words to see if that relationship
obtained. But the evidence relevant to the two must be identical. This can only
be if P and p is true are interdeducible. There is nothing more that goes into p
being true than goers into p.

But we can still ask what makes us sensitive to such justifications. We can
still ask what is going on in us when we reason. But is there any principled way
to suppose that there is some unified activity that goes on under the title of
<q>reasoning</q> any more than that there is some unified notion of
justification which applies to both claims of physics and claims of chemistry.

<p>
I sure want to say there is but is this inconsistent? WHy draw the line here?
