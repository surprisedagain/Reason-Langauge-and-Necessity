<blockquote>
(p.1.1) Reason, according to one traditional view, functions as a source of
knowledge.
</blockquote>
	
<p>
Indeed so, the problem is to explain how an apparently unempirical source (i.e.
justification) of knowledge might function. I am even prepared to simply
stipulate that anything that did not at least sometimes, and to some extent,
justify belief, is not reasoning at all. Even further, I am prepared to
stipulate that reasoning is a kind of psychological process that some people go
through/perform/enact/do from time to time. 
</p>

<p>
[:Some philosopher's might take these stipulations to be definitional truths and
for my part I see no reason to deny them this harmless conceit; except insofar
as it might suggest I am claiming some deep insight into the nature or essential
features of the process of reasoning, perhaps gained by conceptual analysis or
by "coming to see what it is for a person to reason" as Chisholm might put it.
Instead it is simply that I am curious how something can be both a process that
beings such as ourselves can perform <span id="sequential commentary-an initial concern-AND"></span><strong id="AND">AND</strong> an apparently unempirical
justification of belief. I choose to call this process "reasoning" inspired, of
course, by traditional accounts of reasoning and knowledge, but in no way
committed to any particular detail of those accounts beyond the two just
mentioned.
<br>
To put it another way, I am committed to asking: What sort of beings are we that
we are capable of reasoning? What kind of a process is reasoning that beings
such as ourselves are capable of doing it?  But I am more than willing to
consider that previous attempts to answer these questions may have laboured
under false assumptions and misguided constraints.:]
</p>

<p>
The concern is that under this unquestioned element of the "traditional view"
(viz., that reasoning is a source of knowledge) Chisholm will smuggle in a
very questionable account of knowledge, which thence forces us to imagine a
incredible version of reasoning to match.
</p>

<p>
For instance, it might be part of the traditional view that knowledge
requires total certainty, and hence that "reasoning" must be some altogether
fantastic process capable of justifying such certainty.
</p>

<p>
This concern is exacerbated by Chisholm's suggestion that:
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.1.2-3) The alternatives to this view, once <em>they</em> are clearly articulated
may be seen to be at least problematic and to imply an extreme form of
skepticism
</blockquote>

<p>
This appears to set the stage for a false dichotomy between the "traditional
view" and skepticism (on the tacit assumption that if the "traditional view"
ain't true of it, then it ain't knowledge).
</p>

<div id="sequential commentary-on inclusion and exclusion"><h3 id="on inclusion and exclusion" class="header"><a href="#sequential commentary-on inclusion and exclusion">on inclusion and exclusion</a></h3></div>
<p>
Why focus on these "relationships" of inclusion and exclusion?
</p>

<p>
ALL squares are rectangles<br>
AAx [Square(x) =&gt; Rectangle(x)]<br>
</p>

<p>
NO squares are circles<br>
NOT EEx [Square(x) AND Circle(x)]<br>
which is interdeducible in FOL with<br>
AAx not [Square(x) AND Circle(x)]<br>
</p>

<p>
NOT EEx NOT =interdeducible in classical First Order Logic with= AAx<br>
</p>

<p>
So these are the two ways in which universal quantifiers can occur at the
beginning of a statement. Either immediately followed by a negation or not.
In english one is more commonly expressed as a negative existential claim
rather than a positive universal claim. In this case the use of formalism
enables us to see that the distinction between these two forms is a kind of
accident of the english language. One can imagine a language with the same
expressive(/inferential power/computational complexity) which did not have any
two such distinct notations (i.e. a universal quantifier but no existential
one or vice versa).
</p>

<p>
The "challenge" is: how can reasoning be a process which justifies confidence in
such universal claims. Indeed so.
</p>

<p>
Although Chisholm does not say so outright, I suspect that the reason for
focusing on such general claims is two fold: on the one hand it is clear that in
the ordinary course of events we take ourselves to know all sorts of
particular truths <em>a posteriori</em>. There is no felt problem with how I know that I
am sitting on a chair, or typing on a keyboard.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, although some putative "truths of reason" concern particular objects
(e.g. "7 + 5 = 12"). It may be felt that all "truths of reason" have some kind
of element of generality to them.
</p>

<div id="sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction"><h2 id="four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction" class="header"><a href="#sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction">four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction</a></h2></div>
<p>
The first type of argument Chisholms gives for believing that knowledge
of some general truths is justified <em>a priori</em> is that we have knowledge of
genral truths that is not justified by the only method that Chisholm believes of <em>a posteriori</em>
justification that he recognises (viz., "enumerative induction").
</p>

<p>
Chisholm claims that there is only one way other than (pure) reasoning by which
knowledge of universal truths may be justified: viz., by induction, but that the
truths he gives as exemplars of truths of reason are not justified in this other
way.  For my own part I do not believe that any beliefs are justified by
induction any more than I believe that any beliefs are justified by an intuitive
apprehension of their necessity, so this concession is rather besides the point,
but it is worth considering the four reasons/arguments Chisholm gives for
believing that knowledge of these general "truths of reason" is not justified by
"enumerative induction".
</p>

<p>
Chisholm gives three reasons for believing that knowledge of some truths of
reason (including the examples he gives of such truths) cannot be justified by
enumerative induction.
</p>

<div id="sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction-1. some of these truths have no positive instances."><h3 id="1. some of these truths have no positive instances." class="header"><a href="#sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction-1. some of these truths have no positive instances.">1. some of these truths have no positive instances.</a></h3></div>
<p>
For instance, according to Chisholm many people know that all squares are
rectangles, and yet there never have been any squares (nor rectangles) at all.
</p>

<p>
I take it that Chisholm's argument may be rendered as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
Premise 1: Enumerative Induction is the only way of knowledge of general
truths can be justifed <em>a posteriori</em><br>
&gt;&gt; (p.2.1) "If [a] truth were known <em>a posteriori</em> then it would be
justified by some induction or inductions"<br>
<br>    
Premise 2: Enumerative induction requires perception of a range of positive
instances of the property(/ies) involved in the general claim.<br>
&gt;&gt; (p.2.2) "there might be said to be three steps involved in an inductive
justification . . . (1) the accumulation of instances"<br>
<br>    
Premise 3: We have knowledge of universal truths of which there are no
positive instances.<br>
&gt;&gt; (p.3.1)  "If we take 'square,' 'rectangular,' and 'circular' in the
precise way in which these words are usually interpreted in geometry we
must say that nothing is square, rectangular, or circular; . . . [yet we
know that] "Necessarily, being square includes being rectangular and
excludes being circular." "
<hr>
Therefore:<br>
Our knowledge of these universal truths is not
justified <em>a posteriori</em>.
</blockquote>
    
<div id="sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction-1. some of these truths have no positive instances.-2nd premise false"><h4 id="2nd premise false" class="header"><a href="#sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction-1. some of these truths have no positive instances.-2nd premise false">2nd premise false</a></h4></div>
<p>
it is quite common for knowledge of universal truths that lack positive
instances to be
justified a posterori (presumably, given the limited menu of
options he is prepared to countenance Chisholm would count these truths as
justified by induction).
</p>

<p>
Finally, there seem to be a very large number of universal generalisations for
which there are no positive instances and which are yet known  that are known
to be
true that Chilsholm would doubtless hold we know by virtue of inductive
generalisations. (This point is Fodors.)
</p>

<p>
But surely this truth is not knowable a priori. No-one could discern just from
contemplation of the meaning of the term "triphenylphosphine" that it is
extremely poisonous to .

<p>
Although it is not as important for the current purpose of understanding how
knowledge of supposed "truths of reason" is justified, or how it is that we are
aware of this justification; another problem with the , though less important point for our considerations, is that Chisholm's
claim that (p.3.1)  "If we take 'square,' 'rectangular,' and 'circular' in the
precise way in which these words are usually interpreted in geometry we must say
that nothing is square, rectangular, or circular;"
</p>

<p>
this point is Quine's 
Since the falsehood of this example does not establish that 
</p>

<p>
and my point here is only to establish that this is the <span id="sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction-1. some of these truths have no positive instances.-geometrical shapes, including lines, squares, circles exist.-ONLY"></span><strong id="ONLY">ONLY</strong> substantive
reason Chisholm gives for believing that these truths of reason are known a
priori and justified by means quite other than
</p>

<p>
So to that end let us finsih off the argument for the conclusion that Chisholm
gives from the
</p>

<p>
Consider a
square kitchen tile, although the perimeter of its top face is doubtless not
square (in the precise "geometrical interpretation") that 
</p>


<p>
It is not true or at least we have no reason to believe that there are no
squares (even in the strictest "geomterical sense" of the term) nor that
induction cannot justify belief in universal truths which have no positive
instances.
</p>


<p>
(This point is
Quine's, source uncertain - perhaps in a later essay of _From a logical point of
view_, perhaps ????<em>GEOMETRY</em>???? but it is a point he repeats in several places
in any case.)
</p>

<p>
If there are no (geometrical) squares, then this is as much a problem for
Chisholm's account of 
</p>


<p>
The traditional account leaves it completely unclear why intuitive induction
requires perception of individual instances
</p>


<p>
For the fact that a certain specific long carbon chain with various

<p>
One such square has as one side the line the pointAny one of the supposedly
roughly square tiles contains some largest perfect square . It is true there is
no set of atoms which lie perfectly along any of the four lines which make up
that square but geometric
</p>

<p>
To begin with, the only positive account Chisholm gives of the justification of
knowledge of "truths of reason", viz., "intuitive induction" , also starts with
"the perception of the individual things" (p.3.5). Indeed Chisholm points out
that both forms of induction "start with particular instances and then proceed
beyond them" (p.4.1). Thus the lack of "particular instances" to start with
would reasonably be thought to be just as much a problem for justification by
"intuitive induction" as it is for "enumerative induction" and hence no reason
for believing the "traditional view" Chisholm espouses.
</p>

<p>
If the defence is made that we do encounter in our imaginations, then it is
it is claimed that there are squares (in the "geometrical interpretation" after
all.)
</p>

<p>
IMAGINARY SQUARES
Chisholm does give an account of why the lack of actual squares
-&gt; necessity
</p>

<p>
if scientific induction does not allow us to generalise from imaginary squares
(which do exist)
</p>

<p>
Why scientific induction from imaginary squares to squares in general is
unjustified while
</p>

<p>
suppose one imagined a long series of rectangles, one after another, and it just
so happened that each of these rectangles I imagined was blue. it would be a
mistake on the basis of newt induction to complete all rectangles are blue since
this is merely a contingent feature the rectangles and it might be that one
imaginably rectangles because one simply like the colour blue or lack the
imagination to think of other colours always in a particular emotional state or
something of the kind.
</p>

<p>
thus "truths of reason" may be justified by imaginative combination wheras
truths justified a posteriori require actual objects
</p>

"enumerative induction" cannot justify knowledge of necessity</a></h3></div>
<p>
Having failed to find any other reason to suppose that truths of reason cannot
be justified on the same grounds as other general truths (which Chisholm
holds to be induction) let us turn to the positive account Chisholm offers af
what is distinctive about these truths of reason.
</p>

<p>
The chief point fundamental claim upon which all the others rest, is that truths
of reason are necessarily true, and that we can discern these truths <em>a priori</em> by
conemplating or reflecting upon them.
</p>

<p>
SEARCH: mere accumulation of instances
</p>

<p>
Before considering the justification of putatively necessary truths
</p>

<p>
reason - his truths of inclusion and exclusion etc.,- to be necessarily
true, and induction cannot justify knowledge of necessity.
</p>

<p>
belief that a truth is necessary cannot be justified (at least directly)
<em>a posteriori</em>. 
</p>

<div id="sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction-3. &quot;enumerative induction&quot; cannot justify certainty"><h3 id="3. &quot;enumerative induction&quot; cannot justify certainty" class="header"><a href="#sequential commentary-four reasons knowledge of some general truths not justified by induction-3. &quot;enumerative induction&quot; cannot justify certainty">3. "enumerative induction" cannot justify certainty</a></h3></div>
<p>
It is somewhat odd that Chisholm does not lay more weight on this aspect of the
"traditional view".

<p>
as we shall ???? <a href="">see below</a> this doctrine

not least because these truths are necessarily true regardless of whether anyone
holds believes them to be so, or indeed whether or not anyone exists at all. If
Being red excludes belig blue, then it does so regardless.
</p>

<p>
And hence the "apprehension" 
</p>

<p>
It is quite true that people often feel this and they take it as grounds or in
some way a sign that they are justified in being very confident in the inference
(i.e. the full diffidence of the antecedent clause is transferred to the
subsequent.

<p>
this is the skeptical charge that he does consider, and evidently he is aware
that there is a significant problem here

Although Chisholm does not directly advance this fourth reason for beliving that
knowledge of "truths of reason" is not justified by enumerative induction

think it is implicit, in 
</p>

<p>
(p.3.2) "To learn a proposition by experience, and to see it to be necessarily true are
two altogther different processes of thought."
</p>

<p>
This reason is as dubious as the reason just considered, and again CHisholm does
not appear lay great weight upon it. It is simply that we do not

<p>
we do not consciously "assemble/"collect"(/or just plain observe)

genralisation in question (nor as a result of increasingly extended but
failing attempts to produce a counter-example). and;

<p>
It is also worth noting that it is not merely possible for a belief in a truth
to be justified by "enumerative induction" (or some other <em>a posteriori</em> form of
jsutification) without the believer being aware that their belief is so
justified. 
But there are many statements which we now take to be
clearly justified <em>a posteriori</em> (indeed they are generally taken
to be known by "enumerative induction") which were for many centuries
held to be known by "intuitive induction". For example, the statement that heat
rises was thought to be a necessary truth discernable by "seeing into the nature
of things". Indeed, though Chisholm
seems rather careful to avoid mentioning this element of the "traditional view",
on that view (
it was part of that view that there was no distinction between necessity as
exemplified by the axioms and theorems of geometry and causal necessity. In any

<p>
Here we have the exact further elements of "the traditional account" which I was
loathe to accept.  The idea that we are responding to necessity and a priority
is a <span id="necessity and a priority are elements of an explanation-diagnosis"></span><strong id="diagnosis">diagnosis</strong> or <span id="necessity and a priority are elements of an explanation-explanation"></span><strong id="explanation">explanation</strong> of, among other things, our ability to
reliably, and in general, but not perfect, agreement with our peers, sort novel
truths into the two categories which the traditional account describes as
necessary and contingent.  The ability to so sort does suggest that there is
something about these sentences which we are responding to, it does require an
explanation of some sort, but it does <span id="necessity and a priority are elements of an explanation-not"></span><strong id="not">not</strong> in and of itself require us to
accept any one particular explanation of this ability, let alone require us to
grant that what we are responding to in these statements is their being
necessarily true.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that most of us are taught these traditional diagnoses in primary
school, at such a young age that few of us can recall how we learnt to use these
terms. For my own part I have witnessed my own children in 3rd grade being taught
how to use the terms "possible", "impossible" and "necessary" by example.
(Sample statements I witnessed the teacher using to teach students correct
use of the words "possible" and "impossible": "1 + 1 = 3 - no not possible,
"Tomorrow we go to the shops - yes thats possible", Interestingly enough
"Tomorrow the sun will rise in the west - no that's impossible".) The situation
closely resembled Chisholm's fantasy of enumerative induction.
</p>

<p>
We are trained from an early age in the application of the terms "possible" and
"impossible" to various statements and taught that certain applications of these
terms are correct and others are incorrect. The intuitive/felt distinction of
these statements comes first, then a term for applying to the statements that
arouse this felt difference, and then we are given an theory of what that
feeling is a feeling of.
</p>

<p>
To borrow a phrase from <a href="wittgenstein.html">wittgenstein</a>, "internal processes don't come with
labels attached"((I have thus far been unable to find a source for this quote, if Wittgenstein didn't say it, it is certainly the sort of thing he ought to have said :) (mild joke, but it is a consontant with his approach to inner states and processes) )).
The fact we learn to call these statements "necessary" at 
at our parents (and teacher's) knees (and the fact that it is generally the only
"explanation" of this feeling on offer and most of our peers accept it)
we are not required to take this label at face value.
</p>

<p>
Neither the fact that we can distinguish these sentences, nor the fact that we
are taught to call these sentences "necessary" gives us any reason to believe
that these sentences are, in fact, necessary.
</p>

<p>
The key claim is that can be stated is that the observable phenomena is the explanandum
(that which is in need of an explanation/to be explained)
explanation, and that the claim that it is an "intuitiuvwe sense of necessity"
is the that Our ability to distinguish these sentences does require some kind of explanation
but it

Let us turn to clarifying just is that needs to be explained (if it is

<p>
People can reliably and more or less consistently distinguish between sentences
that are, according to the traditional account, necessary truths and sentences
that are not.
</p>

<p>
There is a felt difference <em><span id="necessity and a priority are elements of an explanation-points to be explained-1. &quot;truths of reason&quot; discernable-OF SOME KIND"></span><strong id="OF SOME KIND">OF SOME KIND</strong></em> between

<p>
It is rather odd that Chisholm does not explicitly mention with another reason for
supposeing that "truths of reason" cannot be justified <em>a posteriori</em>
</p>

<p>
that they are known with certainty.
</p>

<p>
People who put (or are disposed to put if asked) a statement into the group
traditionally diagnosed as necessary also nearly always believe that
sentence to be true with great confidence.
</p>

<p>
The statements which arouse the feeling traditionally
diagnosed as "awareness of necessity", are held with great confidence by those
in whom that feeling is aroused; and those in whom thise feeling is aroused are
at a loss to describe the evidence which would lead them to sincerely assert
those sentences.
</p>

<p>
Is is worth noting that "truths of reason"
The high confidence with which the sentences arousing this "awareness of
necessity" and the inability to describe/imagine/depict evidence that would lead
one to hold them as false are not unique to "truths of reason"
</p>

<p>
As we noted above
</p>

<p>
For my own part I am absolutely certain that there have been black dogs (i.e.
that black dogs have existed in the past) and cannot imagine any evidence which
would lead me to accept as true the claim that no such dogs have ever existed.
(No sequence of stimulations of my sensory surfaces will lead from my current
state to a state in which I deny "There have not been black dogs." There are
doubtless sequences which would lead to me dying, others which would lead to me
going insane, and some very unpleasant sequences that would lead to me
pretending to believe [aud loudly declaiming to the torturer] that there have
never been black dogs, but no sequence of observations, experiments, lines of
argument or other considerations that could ever lead me to honestly deny the
past existence of black dogs. Perhaps invasive surgery could accomplish the
trick, but it is unclear whether I would remain a believer at the end of it.)
Despite this I think none of us would group "There have been black dogs" with
sentences such as "1 + 1 = 2" "The internal angles of any euclidean
quadrilateral sum to 360 degrees")
</p>

<p>
Thus I take it that this feeling is not merely the feeling of being certain, but
rather the awareness of some kind of mental process that causes
</p>

<p>
In any case <a href="descartes.html">descartes</a> notoriously proclaimed the sentence "I exist",
to be known same certainty as any putatively necessary truth, but surely that
sentence is not necessarily true. So while any satisfactory explanation would
have to
Though in that case it is the felt necessity of the claim that "If I
believe I exist then I do exist" that underpins. One can have the same

<p>
In the opposite direction People who put (or are disposed to put if asked) a
statement into the group traditionally diagnosed as necessary are nearly always
incapable of describing situations in which such sentences would be false, or of
evidence which would lead them to reduce their confidence in those sentences.
</p>

<p>
When I try to imagine the negation of a "truth for reason"; for example when I
try to imagine a square that is not a rectangle, or a square that is a circle,
or something that is red all over and blue all over, I do not know what to do. I
"get nothing", am lost, cannot imagine what it would be like. Other people
describe their feelings in similar terms. They cannot generally draw pictures of
a situation in which that sentence is true (literal pictures, not game of
charades style instructions for assembling the sound or shape of the words
forming the sentence).  Furthermore they are at a loss when asked what evidence
they would accept as justification for holding such a claim to be true.

Finally, but perhaps most importantly, I also maintain my initial

Many statements that aroused this distinctive sense
true distinctive
feeling (which has in the European intellectual tradition at least, been
supposed to be aroused by necessary and a priori truths/truths of reason,) in
the highest degree and in the keenest minds  was
aroused in the keenest minds of humanity by statement that later turned out to
be false.  The claim that a single line passes through any two distinct points
or, the internal angles of a right angle triangle sum to two right angles,
excited precisely this same intuition. One could save the intuition by saying
that these did not <em>really</em> arouse this intuition at all, they aroused some
simulacra, a "mere feeling", which was phenomenologically indistinguishable but
not a mark of the same necessity and a priority at all.  That what we are
sensing in the case of "1 + 1 = 2" or "No square is a circle" is <span id="necessity and a priority are elements of an explanation-problems for Chisholm's traditional explanation-many false statements have evoked intuition-NECESSITY"></span><strong id="NECESSITY">NECESSITY</strong>

certainty (and bear in mind that not only did theorems of Euclidean but they
were the prime exemplars of "truhts of reason" and pardigmatic examples of the
statements arousing this feeling).
Then it oulwd have been impossible for people to have this feeling and for thsoe
statements to have been false. But, to put it breifly, they did and they were.

<p>
Any theory according to which this feeling was a certain

explanation must explain how it was possible for this feeling to lead us
astray, and not merely as a matter of confusion, or a mistake made by the very
brightest minds FOR CENTURIES, that they simply misdiagnosed this feeling, or
misunderstood the sentences the sentences that aroused this feeling in them
under the very best conditions, when they were thinking at their clearest,

(p.5.3) We might say, therefore, that an <em>a priori</em> proposition is one such
that, if you accept it, then it becomes certain for you. (For if you accept

certain for you.) 
</blockquote>

<p>
Just why do some "truths of reason" evoke this sense of certainty and others do
not.
</p>

<p>
One tempting explanation is failure to understand, perhaps becasue the statement
in question is too complex:
(p.6.1) "Failure to accept their conjunction need not be a sign that S is unrea-
sonable. It may be a sign merely that the conjunction is too complex an object
for S to grasp."

On this point In any case Chisholm certainly does not provide any account of how
it is that we "see" necessary truths, and I to present an account of how the non

<p>
It is true that in several places Chisholm does <em>talk</em> as if he has given a
different explanation of how belief in "truths of reason" may be justified. He
sometimes says things like "we come to see what it is for a thing to have the
property of being human" (p.3.5), and "by contemplating or reflecting upon
certain propositions or states of affairs we will be able to see that they are
necessary" (p.5.1-2), but it is worth noting that this is no explanation at all.
This traditional "explanation" of knowledge of "a priori truths" is so widely
promulgated, and has such a long-standing history of authoritative support (in
the European philosophical tradition) that it is easy to become innured to just
how bad an explanation it is. The poverty of this explanation can, however, be
brought to attention by transferring it to a different subject matter.

<p>
Suppose, that an architect were to come up to you and tell you that your house

the assumption that the only alternative to deduction from first principles and
sensation, is induction from first principles and sensation seems to be the
result of Chilsholm's atomism and foundationalism. By atomism I mean the
assumption that the units of justification (the fundamental entities that are

It seems unfair not to venture at least a sketch of an alternative explanation
for the phenomena outlined above (in <a href="truths_of_reason_by_chisholm.html#points to be explained">#points to be explained</a>). It is easy to
criticise another's theories
</p>

<p>
Before attempting to venture an alternative explanation however, I would like to
emphasize, that even if the alternative I offer is hopeless
it does not make Chisholm's "explanation" any better. It would be far better and
more honest to simply say we do not know what is distinctive about these
statements nor how we are aware of that distinctive property, nor how our belief
in them is justified. This need not lead to skepticism,

For he goes on to quote at length (and one must suppose approvingly) from

An omitted discussion of generalisation without positive instances which I
believe is connected with vagueness. I still believe this is usefully connected
with the problem of vagueness (which is a genuine problem in need of a solution,
but I believe to be unsolvable on the "traditional view", hence a reason for
abandoning that view in favour of the one I advicate.
</p>

<p>
In my view the underlying difficulty is that the term square (in ordinary
usage, and without postulating any special "geometrical interpretation" of the
term) is somewhat vague. For each clear instance of a square there is a surrounding
penumbra of borderline cases - possible things that are neither clearly square
nor not square.  (Just as for each bald man we are able to
describe/depict/imagine a penumbra of slightly more hairy men who are neither
quite bald nor hirsute.)
</p>

<p>
Furthermore competent speakers commonly vary this penumbra, and adjust the
strictness of the range of objects of which they hold "square" to be true to fit
their purposes of the moment. For example, for the purposes of baking a cake a
given tin may count as square. A baker might without hesitation or confusion ask
for and receive a square cake tin from the assistnt baker, and if for some
reason the matter qere further questioned both baker and assistant would respond
confidently and affirmatively to the question "Is that the square tin?". For the
purpose of guiding the cutting of tiles, however, that very same tin might not
count as square. Looking for a jury-rigged method for cutting square tiles
(perhaps because the right tools had been left on the other truck) the tile
layer might reject that tin on the basis that "It is not square". Nor, equally
might that tin (or any other count as squae for the purposes of advancing
geo=metrical arguments

<p>
This phenomena is well recognised as presenting a serious difficulty for the
"traditional view" Chisholm is advocating. It seems to me to be far more

<p>
For on that "traditional view"

<p>
To begin with, it seems to me that the fact that even prima facie sharp terms
such as "square" are vague, is even more of a problem for the "traditional view"
which Chisholm advocates than it is the alternatives. For according

or false, but rather treated as true and that we can and do as a matter of
course adjust our standards of what counts as a square
You can't fit a square peg through a round hole.
</p>

<p>
It is perhaps, interesting that many native English speakers first learn to use
the term "square" by observing experienced English speakers conspicuously
applying the term to conspicuous squares, and (hopefully) being warmly
encouraged when, in turn, they are witnessed applying the term to discernable
squares themselves (see <a href="epistemic_triangle_of_language_learning.html">epistemic_triangle_of_language_learning</a>). Then go on
to learn a variety of different standards by which objects of various different
types are correctly judged to be square (or not); one standard by which cakes
are correctly judged to be square or not, another by which kitchen tiles are
correctly judged square or not, and so on. And somewhere along the line, learn a
standard of squareness so stringent that none of the exemplars from which they
originally learnt the term "square" count as square by that standard at all.
</p>

<p>
But rather than being led to believe that people have some unempirical source
of knowledge concerning what the property expressed by "square" (under the
"geomterical interpretation") excludes and includes, consideration of the fact
that many people learn to use the term "square" in this way 
leads me to doubt that terms such as "square" function by
expressing properties at all; for it seems equally unsatisfactory to hold the
term "square" to be either syncategorematic (i.e. to occur in the unstructured
terms "square-cake" and "square-tile" in the same way that "cat" occurs in
"catapult") or ambiguous (i.e. to have a different meaning in application to
cakes than in application to kitchen tiles).

<p>
and the ability to correctly categorise objects under novel composite categories
(i.e. the ability, having learnt what a square, square tile to go on without
further training or instruction to correctly distinguish square tables from
non-square tables) seems to me to be exactly what the postulation of concepts
was meant to explain. Grasping the relevant concept allowed one to correctly
assess, without being trained on each particular case,

<p>
since having learnt to distinguish square-tins, square-cakes, and
square-tiles, many of us are able to distinguish square-tables
without further training it would be deeply contrary to the "traditional
view" for square to fail to express a distinct "concept"(/"property")concept
which contributed to the the meanings of such compound terms.
