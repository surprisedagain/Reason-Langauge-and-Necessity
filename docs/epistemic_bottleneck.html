We shall spend a great deal of time talking about evidence and how it relates to
contentive(/representational/semantically evaluable) things such as statememts
and theories. Let us clarify just what we count as evidence.

We know of some objects only through their effects on other objects to which we
have comparatively direct epistemic access. Stars too faint to be seen by the
naked eye, for example, are known to us only through their effects on
photographic plates, the antennae of radio telescopes and other astronomical
equipment. I propose to call this kind of epistemic dependency an epistemic
bottleneck. We shall speak of the objects, like faint stars, which are known
only indirectly as being on the <em>far side</em> of the relevant bottleneck, and the
objects through which they are known as being <em>in</em> the relevant bottleneck.

<p>
Some empiricists (and Kant, <a href="critique_of_pure_reason.html#senses an epistemic bottleneck">in his way</a>) have thought there must be special
objects, sometimes dubbed "sense-data", that are known of directly and
infallibly; and that all the other objects we know of, are known only through
their effects on these sense-data. Quine offered a radically different account
of the evidence upon which our theories are ultimately based. Rejecting hope of
any knowledge more certain than scientific theories based upon empirical
investigation, he availed himself unashamedly of the empirical hypothesis that
we receive all our information about the world via the firings of our sensory
receptors, and took <a href="quines_stimuli.html">stimuli</a> to be the ultimate evidence upon
which our all our theories are based.  Unlike the sense-data postulated by
earlier empiricists, these stimuli were not supposed to be known infallibly nor,
in general, to be referred to (even covertly) in the statements for which they
were evidence.  Indeed, as Quine was at pains to point out, they were not even
incorrigible evidence --- our stimuli might be good evidence for statements
that, on reflection, we find to be false.  Still, Quine held our stimuli to be
the ultimate evidence on which our theories of the world are based, on the
grounds that they are both an epistemic  bottleneck through which all our
information about the external world must flow before going on to cause our
beliefs, and because they are in practice the last clear and public cause of our
beliefs.
</p>

<p>
If there were some form of ultimate evidence, whether sense-data, stimuli or
what have you, those objects would be in a epistemic bottleneck of which the
entire world was on the far side (or in the case of stimuli, at least the world
beyond their subject's body). If there is such ultimate evidence then, as Quine
puts it, "The world with its quarks and chromosomes, its distant lands and
spiral nebulae, is like  a vast computer in a black box, forever sealed apart
from its input and output registers"({local:zz.texts/quine1978.webOfBelief}
p.22.1). But the views advance in this collection of notes do not rely upon the
existence of such an all encompassing epistemic bottleneck, nor of such ultimate
evidence.  But only the more humble claim that there are some epistemic
bottlenecks or other at some points in the flow of information to us from the
objects of which we have knowledge. Even if there are no clear input and output
registers, and what is taken as "ultimate evidence" depends on context and
passing interests, that is still compatible with the existence of epistemic
bottlenecks, and hence still compatible with the arguments on offer here.
