Language represents a system(/the world) by virtue of an ismorphism between
the permissible arrangements of symbols into sentences and the possible
arrangements of the system they represent.
</p>

<p>
This (purports to) explain how we know necessary truths about such external
systems.  We can be taught the <a href="wittgenstein_grammar_vs_grammar.html">grammatically</a>
permissible combinations of symbols by experience, and the modal structure of
the represented systems MUST be the same since this is a pre-requisite of it
being the thing (the type of thing) that those symbols represent.
</p>

<p>
The apparent dependency on normativity can be largely dispelled by simply
specifying the relevant grammtical constructions explicitly. While it is
normative rules that give rise to "grammaticality" in natural langauges, one can
simply stipulate the set of <a href="wittgenstein_grammar_vs_grammar.html">grammatically</a>
correct sentences and thus establish the relevant space of gramatical
possibilities.
</p>

<p>
There are at least two suspicions remaining however:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Is there still a reliance upon an unresolved knowledge of modality?

</ol>

<p>
	At first, perhaps it seems that we surely know the possibilities of ur own
	minds better than the possibilities of some external objects/states of
	affairs. We can "directly" experience the possibilites of our own mind
	unconstriained by the limits of base external reality.
	How is it that we know what combinations of symbols are possible? But here
	it seems the combinations can be made purely of existing, if "abstract"
	entites and relationships.  Consider <a href="quine's_account_of_logical_truth.html">quine's_account_of_logical_truth</a>
	where the set of grammatically correct sentences and the set of logical
	truths is specified without any reliance upon modal notions at all. 
</p>
 
<ol>
<li>
Is it really the case that "(6.43) . . .
   <a href="the_world_of_the_happy_man.html">the_world_of_the_happy_man</a> is a
   different one from that of the unhappy man"?

<p>
Another aspect of W's approach that must be mentioned is the notion of finding a
logical_basis for the space of grammatically correct statements. This is
directly analogous to the notion of a basis of a mathematical vector space.
There the notion is that any vector in the space (mutatis mutandis any point in
the space) can be reached/expressed/constructed as a combination<span class='tooltip'>*<span class='tooltiptext'>sum of multiples</span></span>
of the members of the basis.
