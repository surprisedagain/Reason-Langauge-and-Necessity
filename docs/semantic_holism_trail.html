Semantic holism is the doctrine that the primary bearers of meaning are whole
theories and not individual sentences.
</p>

<p>
This trail leads from a description of evidence to an argument for semantic
holism and thence to some of semantic holism's consequences.

This work is mainly concerned with the relationship between representations,
primarily though not exclusively linguistic representations, and the objects
they represent.
</p>

<p>
what sort of knowledge can we have of object on the far side of an epistemic
bottleneck. Which at are the entities that are justified by the evidence (in
(e.g. individual sentences or whole theories)
</p>


<p>
The key doctrines that are argued for are confirmation holism. Which is a
relationship between representations and the 
</p>

<p>
the nature of claims that they can be about object
</p>

<p>
Thus the first step is to attempt to clarify the notion of an
<a class="heavy" href="epistemic_bottleneck.html">epistemic_bottleneck</a> !!!!!
and support the claim that, at least provisionally, there are such bottlenecks
and what our assumptions are concerning our epsitemic .
And vindicate the claim that there are such bottlenecks by providing some
concrete examples.
</p>


<p>
What is the basis of our knowledge concerning objects on the far side of an
epistemic bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
What can we know about the objects on the far side of an epistemic bottleneck.
One obvious staring point being can we know that there are objects on the far
side of an epistemic bottle neck, and if so what is the evidence for that claim.
When does our knowledge of what happens <em>in</em> an epistemic bottleneck, justify us
in believing that there is something on the <em>far</em> side of it at all?
</p>

<p>
What must be true about the statements about objects on the far side of a
bottleneck in order that we could know them to
be true.
</p>

<p>
What can we tell about the meanings of our sentences, or rather the nature of
lingusitic representation, the way language works, the way the truth and falsity
of our sentences is determined
</p>

<p>
But we are not only interested in the nature of our knowledge concerning objects
on the far side of epistemic bottlenecks, and the relationship between the
objects that make our claims concerning those distant objects true and the
evidence for them.
</p>

<p>
what states of affairs of things on the far side can we have evidence for
</p>

<p>
We are also interested in the relationship between the things on this side that
represent object on the far side of the bottleneck. What things on our side are
confirmed by the. How must representations be related to the objects ain what
way must the represent in orde3r that they can be true.
</p>

<p>
What must be true of the things on this side that they can correctly represent
objects on the far side of an epsitemic bottleneck, and what is their
relationship.
</p>

<p>
What is the relationship between the objects on this side and the
</p>

<p>
What must be the relationship between our statements and the cnoditions that
they can be true nd we can know them to be true.

<p>
A guiding principle is a kind of anti-skepticism. This is not to simply
dogmatically assert that we do have know. But rather 
On the assumption that we do have knowledge
</p>

<p>
It may be that the notion of an epistemic bottleneck is hopelessly misguided,
but if there are such bottlenecks, we do have knowledge.
</p>

<p>
This assumption is not absolute, if after all we cannot find any way
</p>

<p>
On the assumption theat we do have knowledge of objects on the far side of
epistemic bottlenecks, what must the nature of that knowledge be, what is the
evidence for it, and what is the content of that 
</p>

<p>
We are particualrly concerned 
thus what is the unit of confirmation,
</p>

<p>
This can be put also as methological humility. If our epistemic theory implies
that we do not know 
</p>

<p>
this is where epistemic triangles would fit in - if they are still required
</p>


<p>
Confirmation Holism
   Confirmation holism is the doctrine that the entities con/infirmed by
   evidence are whole theories. In order to clarify this doctrine we start by
   clarifying the notion of evidence relative to one or another epistemic
   bottleneck:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="epistemic_bottleneck.html">epistemic_bottleneck</a>
   having clarified the term <q>epistemic bottleneck</q> we then go on to make
   various

<li>
<a href="why_postulate_remote_objects.html">why_postulate_remote_objects</a>

</ul>

<p>
if confirmation holism is true then
sum p &gt; 1
we cannot distinguish analytic truths
translation is indeterminate
the unit of meaning is aloso the whole theory i.e. semantic holism
</p>

when does the evidence justify us in believing that there are objects on the far
side of an epistemic bottleneck?
</p>


<p>
To what extent can our statements about the objects on the far side of a bottle
neck be justified, what are the entities justified by 
</p>

<p>
as a first question - when are we justified in believing that there is anythjing
on the far side
</p>


<p>
the simplest answer is never: this is the answer given by the positivists and
the logical positivists
</p>
<blockquote>
The fundamental doctrine of a true philosophy, according to M. Comte, and
the character by which he defines Positive Philosophy, is the following:—We
have no knowledge of anything but Phaenomena; and our knowledge of
phaenomena is relative, not absolute. We know not the essence, nor the real
mode of production, of any fact, but only its relations to other facts in
the way of succession or of similitude. These relations are constant; that
is, always the same in the same circumstances. The constant resemblances
which link phaenomena together, and the constant sequences which unite them
as antecedent and consequent, are termed their laws. The laws of phaenomena
are all we know respecting them. Their essential nature, and their ultimate
causes, either efficient or final, are unknown and inscrutable to us.

</ul>

<p>
A religion must be something by which to "systematize" human life. His
definition of it, in the "Catéchisme," is "the state of complete unity which
distinguishes our existence, at once personal and social, when all its parts,
both moral and physical, converge habitually to a common destination&hellip;. Such a
harmony, individual and collective, being incapable of complete realization in
an existence so complicated as ours, this definition of religion characterizes
the immovable type towards which tends more and more the aggregate of human
efforts. Our happiness and our merit consist especially in approaching as near
as possible to this unity, of which the gradual increase constitutes the best
measure of real improvement, personal or social.

<p>
given that wew can tell when
</p>

<p>
whenever the bliefs are justified then the corresponding belief must be true.
thus we can get an angle of the truth-conditions of those sentences.
this is in a sense the Kantian/copernican revolution
</p>

<p>
what are the truth conditions of the statements about objects on the far side of
an epistemic bottleneck such that our belief in them could be justified.
</p>

<p>
On your (lets call it realist, thouogh of course I amintain that my position is
the only form of realism  there is) interpretation there is no jusitifcation for
believing our beliefs (concerning far objects) to be true, thus you fall into
skepticism. But skepticism is false many of our beliefs are justified, at least
by the standards around here. So what must our beliefs be 
</p>

<p>
???^^^ is this a bridge from confirmation holism to semantic holism - they
have to be claims that are actually confirmed.
</p>

<p>
if truth, correct representation that the the concepts in the claim stood in some 1-1 correspondence relationship to
the properties of the far obejct, then we would have no reason to believe them
to be true sicne there would always be other implementations that manifested the
same evidence - but we are justified in beliving those theories with greater
confidence (sum of confidence &gt; 1)

The problem

Do two halting Turing machines accept the same language (or compute the same "function")?

<p>
Let 𝑀
 be an arbitrary Turing machine. Let 𝑀′
 be a Turing machine that on input 𝑥
, simulates 𝑀
 (on some predefined input) for |𝑥|
 steps and accepts if (and only if) 𝑀
 halts within |𝑥|
 steps (or, if you want to go with a TM computing a function, returns 1
 if 𝑀
 halts within |𝑥|
 steps and 0
 otherwise).
</p>

<p>
If 𝑀
 doesn't halt then 𝑀′
 accepts the empty language (or, computes the function 𝑓(𝑥)=0
). If 𝑀
 does halt then the language 𝑀′
 accepts is non-empty (or, the function is non-constant).
</p>

<p>
This gives a reduction from the Halting problem to the problem of detecting equality, since we just need to ask whether 𝑀′
 is equal to the machine accepting the empty language (or, the machine computing the function 𝑓(𝑥)=0
).
</p>

<p>
This avoids all the issues of the function not being total or being unable to construct the function explicitly.

The last and most influential philosophical movement held that the account of
meaning was intimately conencted with our knowledge of necessary truths. Holding
that these were true by virtue of meaning alone. For this reason alone it would
be worhtwhile to understand

<p>
////if we could deliniate the right set of represetations/statements in non modal
terms then we can deliniate the class of possible truths then we could account
for knowledge of the truths of reason. (This motivation is the basis for
analytic philosophy and needs to be mentioned in that context in the historical

<p>
We begin this path with a defence of confirmation holism. That the relationship
between evidence and the beliefs that are justified by that evidence, obtains,
fundamentally and in the first place** between evidence and whole theories,
rather than, for instance evidence and individual statements or individual
thoughts. In order to make that clear we must begin be a schematic account of
<a href="epistemic_bottleneck.html">epistemic_bottleneck</a>.
By schema is this
meant some special logical abstraction? Does everything have a schema, and what
is the relationship between a scehmatric escription and a non schematic
description - it sounds lot like the distinction between the superfical and the
<q>deep</q> logical form of a statement,
???? that we rejected with wittgenstein
</p>

<p>
we choose thsoe elements of evidence that are qequired for the rest of the
argument concerning confirmational (and thence semantic) holism. The obvious
truths that are sufficnet to establish the intended argument. We make no
pretense at neutrality, or hewing to a level of specificzation that is somehow
<q>built into nature</q>????.
</p>

<p>
We are however ontologically neutral when it comes to a scientific/traditional
account of perception. The evidence may equally well be taken as stimuli or
sense-data or kantian intuitions the argument goes through .
</p>

<p>
The defect in such sparse/schematic descriptions is that they may conceal some
subtle contradiction that only comes to light once the the scheme is attmepted
to be filled out.
</p>

<p>
this is not so bad if we are tryi9ng option 1 - vindicating the scientifc world
view. ???? WHY ????
</p>

<p>
With evidence made clear we can begin to describe the complexity of the
relationship between evidence that the statements in which belief is justifed by
that evidence

verificationism??
in some ways the earliest versions of verificationism are more restrictive that
even Descarets account.
For D claimed that
</p>

<p>
oldest best version: two statements are synonymous just in case they are
confirmed and infirmed by the same courses of experience.
</p>

<p>
the evidence for the truth of a claim exhausts the evidence available for
determining the meaning of that claim - there is a link here to deflationism
epistemic triangle
</p>


<p>
in hindsight we can see that this was the issue that motivated Descartes all
along - this concern was implicit
## recap of Descartes concerns over under-determination
</p>

<p>
Independently of the thesis about the complexity of the relationship between
evidence and theory, verificationism, has a consequence that is of
fundam,ental/extreme/significant** relevant to as just described the complexity of the connection
between evidence and the statements that are justified by that evidence there is
an important consequence of this verificationist principle.

How is it that our beliefs (i.e. the

about the world at all? It seems that when we are justified in believing
we are justified in beliving it to be true, and it is true

suppose that they whenever someone asserted a statement, i.e. whenever that
evidence obtained we could see the fact behind the scene. Whenever they say Gold
there is aome au23 (or whatever it is) in front of them.
</p>

<p>
But we also see that other evidence would prompt them to assert gold (i.e. they
their evidence is not sufficient to distingusih between gold and fool's gold.)
</p>

<p>
Suppose that there was, in their environemnt, at least the whole of the
environemnt in which speakers of that language were found only gold and no fools
gold.
</p>

<p>
Suppose they expand from that region into a region where they come across fools
gold on a more or less regular basis. Ifr it seems significant maybe now more
than 50% of the stuff they suppose is gold (or talk about as) is fools gold, but
maybe its just 10% of the supposed gold that is fool's gold. In any case a
significant proportion (though not necessarily evenly distributed) of the
suppsed gold make it more than 50% if you think its important ????
</p>

<p>
Now suppose that they gain access to evidence which allows them to distinguish
gold from fools gold. Maybe they build a spectroscope or some special piece of
machinery that gioves them access to experimental results that they could not
previously obtain. Maybe they get access to the neighbouring valley and can look
at the relevant mountain from the other side. 
</p>

<p>
And they decide to keep the term to describe both types of object. Here we have
something like Putnam's Jade case.
</p>

<p>
Let us vary the order of events somewhat, suppose again that we have a
culture/community/tribe which cannot distinguish between gold and fools gold and
applies the same term to both. And again they live in a region where although
fool's gold is, as they like to say, nomologically possible, none actually
occurs. Again all the stuff these people call gold is actually gold1. Now they
develop the ability to distinguish between gold1 and fools gold.
</p>

<p>
It may be that distinguishing between these two was not part of the motivation
for developing the techniques/apparatus/whatever it was that enabled them to
acquire the evidence distinguishing between gold1 and gold2. They had no idea
that gold2 existed (though it might have been something, like dark matter today,
whose existence they suspected but had not been able to verify).
</p>

<p>
Now, subsequently to developing the ability to distinguish gold1 (which they
continue to call gold) and gold2 (which they call dark gold) they expand into a
different region or somehow come across some gold2 for the first time.
