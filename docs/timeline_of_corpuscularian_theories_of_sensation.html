<p>
a rough timeline of some of the key events in the development of theories
according to which sensory organs (for senses other than touch) respond to the
impingement of sub-visible corpuscles by sending signals to the brain or heart.

<p>
Gassendi's main argument for beliving in sub-visible particles is that paving
stones and plowshares gradually wear away because of constant rubbing even
though individual acts of rubbing produce no discernible change.
</p>

<p>
Another is that the passage of odors through the air can be explained in terms
of tiny particles traveling from the original body to the nose.
</p>

<p>
Gassendi's argument for the indivisibility of these particles (atoms) is based
upon Zeno's paradox.
</p>

<p>
Gassendi's belief in the void is largely, though not entirely, based upon
consideration of the space (void) at the top of mercury barometers.
</p>

<p>
Galileo came to realize that acceleration was not an accidental property of the
motion of fall, but was governed by a simple mathematical law. In a 1604 letter
to Paolo Sarpi, Galileo stated that the spaces traversed in a naturally
accelerated motion are to each other as the squares of the times. Galileo
curiously derived the correct law from the false assumption that the speed of
fall grows in proportion to the space traversed, rather than to the time
elapsed.
