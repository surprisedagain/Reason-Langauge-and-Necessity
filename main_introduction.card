A historical introduction to the grave and fundamental problems for which
solutions are ventured in this treatise.

= the collapse of traditional accounts of reasoning =
Long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us to truth. Our minds
contained concepts, and these concepts were either the very same as the
properties of the objects around us or at least very similar to them. (Perhaps
in something like the way that an object and its impression in a clay tablet are
similar.) Maybe these concepts were imprinted in our minds through our senses,
or maybe they were perfect forms of which physical properties were imperfect
copies. But in either case there was a consonance between our concepts and the
properties of the objects around us.  The sensation felt when touching a flame
was thought to be similar to the heat which causes the flame to burn, the weight
felt when lifting a stone similar to the weight in the stone which caused it to
resist being pushed, and the color seen when looking at a white patch of snow
similar to the whiteness of the snow.  Because of these direct encounters with
objects' properties we could intuit the fundamental general principles governing
them. 

A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the material world around us (i.e. discern God's
ineffable plan)((Leibniz is perhaps the last influential exponent of this claim.)); but even limited intellects such as ours could determine
which combinations of properties were possible or impossible by examining which
combinations of concepts we could conceive of <q>clearly and distinctly</q> (in
Descartes' famous phrase).  Objects that could not be conceived, such as round
squares, or triangles whose internal angles did not sum to two right angles,
were impossible.

The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume), was geometry.
Geometry taken, not as we now understand it, as an investigation into various
non-physical mathematical idealisations, but as the ancients understood it, an
investigation into the spatial properties of physical objects. Geometry was the
exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was taken to show that
reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles imprinted in us by
experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and observation, could produce
substantial knowledge of the necessary structure of the world.  There were, of
course, famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the fallibility of
the senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that our
justifications for beliefs about the external world did not reach the standard
set by geometry.  Rather than challenging the classical theory of knowledge, the
ancient skeptics simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.

In the European intellectual tradition, philosophers began to note the cracks
heralding the long, unstoppable, collapse of these accounts of reason and
knowledge shortly before 1650. It is, of course, impossible to put a precise
date upon when the collapse began or ended.  At first, awareness of the problems
in the traditional accounts spread piecemeal, and when they were noted they did
not immediately give rise to despair, but rather to various attempts to repair
or resolve them.  The death-knell of the ancient account of reasoning might
reasonably be said to have been struck in 1919, when decisive empirical evidence
was gathered confirming Einstein's theory that physical space was not Euclidean.
But some thinkers had abandoned hope in the old scheme long before this, while
others continued to hold faith in it even after this point (see [[truths_of_reason_by_chisholm|Chisholm, 1987]])
and even in those who officially abandoned it, its influence continues to run
deep (see [[#What counts as knowledge? What counts a reasoning?|below]]).

The key factor that caused this collapse, was the undeniable growth in
scientific knowledge. This growth posed two distinct and fundamental problems
for the traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning.

== 1st problem: the justification of scientific theories ==
While the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor
known with the same certainty as geometrical principles, it was not preposterous
to cast them as being like geometrical principles in being necessarily true
and known with greater certainty than the observable consequences derived
from them. Both geometrical and physical principles could be held to be made
true by the essential natures of the objects and properties they concerned. On
this view, the Aristotelian principle that heat rises, for instance, is not an
empirical generalisation, but an essential aspect of the nature of heat. An
aspect that may be grasped, by a mind capable of contemplating general laws, in
a flash of cognition after repeatedly observing hot objects. The new scientific
laws, however, could not be made to fit into this mold.

At every point, the fundamental generalisations forming the core of scientific
theories are unlike necessary first principles grasped with certainty in a flash
of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant properties.

==== not sensible properties ====
To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in scientific
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  By contrast, human sensory organs are
not sensitive to properties such as charge, field strength and spin.

Even the attributions of those properties that might be thought to be sensible,
such as wavelength and mass, is often at odds with ordinary sensations.  The
mass of an object, for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is
dependent upon gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras
the former remains unchanged even in micro-gravity. Thus even though we sense
something commonly correlated with mass (perhaps the force exerted on our
bodies), we do not sense the mass of objects.

==== not necessary truths ====
The next difference is that scientific generalisations are not true necessarily.
[[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2023/entries/popper/|Popper]] is perhaps the most influential exponent of this claim. He proclaimed
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability|falsifiability]] to be the hallmark of scientific claims.  According
to Popper, a general statement is falsifiable if and only if there is a possible
<q>basic statement</q> (i.e. a singular existential claim, such as <q>the needle
on the voltmeter is pointing to 11</q>) whose truth is <q>intersubjectively
testable</q> (i.e.  about which observers can come to agreement despite other
differences in their beliefs) with which that general statement is incompatible.
But of course, necessary truths are compatible with every <q>basic statement</q>
and hence, by Popper's standard, not scientific((and, _tollens_ to _ponens_, no scientific truth is necessary)).

Independently of Popper's standard for scientific enquiry, principles such as
the right hand rule governing the movement of charged particles through
magnetic fields have obvious symmetric alternatives that are equally plausible
_a priori_ and yet mutually exclusive. While other principles, such as
<q>Elements with eight electrons in their outer shell are inert</q> are too palpably
arbitrary to be necessary.

In the other direction, while we may be confident that Newtonian mechanics is
false, it is implausible that it is impossible (or if so, it makes knowledge of
impossibility inaccessible to even the keenest minds for indefinite periods of
time).

==== not known with certainty ====
While Popper formulated his falsification principle in the mid 20th
century, by 1650 [[Descartes]] had already recognised that scientific claims gained
credence via their success in predicting observations.  For several
centuries afterwards, it was only dimly apprehended((by everyone apart, perhaps, from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes|Reverend Bayes]]))
that for an experience to give credence to a hypothesis,
[[if_some_experiences_confirm_others_must_infirm|there must be other possible experiences which would confute it]]
(hence Popper's emphasis on falsification); but it _was_ widely understood that
belief in scientific theories was justified by their success in predicting
observations and that they were _not deducible from_ (descriptions of) those
observations.

There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10; and secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
_guarantee_ the truth of the general scientific principles they support. It
is possible for a supposedly universal law to be vindicated by any finite number
of observations and yet be false.

==== known less certainly than their consequences ====
Another point of difference between scientific laws and Aristotelian first
principles, is that scientific laws are known with less certainty than the
particular cases fulfilling them; wheras geometical and arithemetic laws are
known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they subsume.

Most of us, for instance, are more certain that addition is symmetric
(i.e. that for any pair of numbers _n_ and _m_, _n_ + _m_ = _m_ + _n_) than that
38974298435982 + 87248912374 = 87248912374 + 38974298435982. A modern view may
ascribe this uncertainty to the difficulty of determining whether the particular
case presented falls under the general rule (i.e.  whether, among other things,
the sixth digit of last number in the equation just given is the same as the
sixth digit in the first). Plato, by contrast, relied upon a looser and
more complex relationship between ordinary objects and the forms than
instantiation _simpliciter_; he held that ordinary objects realise forms only
imperfectly((see {[[truths_of_reason_by_chisholm#Geometrical figures exist|Chisholm's discussion of geometrical figures]]} for a modern exponent of the view)).  This shortcoming means that ordinary sensible objects may fail
to fulfill the laws obtaining between the forms they imperfectly instantiate. In
either case the general law is more certain that its exemplification in any
given instance.

By contrast, scientific generalisations, even mundane ones such as <q>Blue
litmus paper turns red when immersed in acid</q> are known with less certainty
than particular observations of their instances.  Indeed on the modern view it
follows from fundamental principles of probability that such generalizations
must be less certain than observations of any particular positive instance.
For the falsehood of any of instance would render the universal claim false as
well, and hence the probability of the universal claim must be lower than the
probability of that claim being fulfilled in any particular case where it
applies.

==== not intuitable as a result of observation ====
The final point of difference, which is also the most difficult to make sense of
from the modern viewpoint, is that scientific laws are not grasped in a flash of
insight after repeated sensation. After repeated encounters with circles, one
might in a sudden insight, realise that each is a set of points equidistant from
a centre. After repeated encounters with lines, one may realise that just one
line passes through any pair of distinct points. But one does not, after
repeatedly lifting heavy objects, suddenly realise that the gravitational
constant is 6.6743 +/- 0.00015 x 10^-11^ Newton square meters per square
kilogram.

=== consequences of these differences ===
The differences just noted make it clear that knowledge of scientific
generalisations is not justified in the way prescribed by the traditional view.
Such is the tenacity and strength of the traditional view's hold on modern minds
however, that a dawning realisation that our knowledge of scientific truths is
not justified in this way, often first manifests itself as scepticism; a denial
that we have knowledge of scientific generalizations at all.

So it was for [[Descartes]], though he claimed his skepticism was merely
methodological.  The starting point of his {[[descartes#cogito|cogito]]} is the
realisation that that our theories of the external world could not be deduced
from observations and necessary first principles, and hence our knowledge of
them was dubious.  This doubt became known as <q>Cartesian scepticism</q> and
went on to become a central problem of early modern philosophy((in Kant's words, <q>the scandal of philosophy</q>)).
His subsequent attempt to place our knowledge of scientific theories on the same
solid, deductive, foundations as geometry and mathematics, however, was derided
as ridiculous by many of his [[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dKxa3gAvWR8C|contemporaries]], and largely treated as a second
rate addendum by his successors.

So it remains for many philosophy students today, who often leave their first
year encounter with Cartesian scepticism convinced that the take home message of
philosophy is that no-one _really_ knows anything except their own experiences
and perhaps some mathematics; i.e.  truths of which the traditional account of
knowledge remains at least superficially plausible.  Nor is this insistence upon
rejecting all claims of knowledge that are not justified by the lights of the
traditional view limited to pioneers and novices. Russell notes the wide spread
of this scepticism in his complaint that <q>. . . when people begin to
philosophize they seem to think it necessary to make themselves artificially
stupid</q>((_Theory of knowledg_ from [[https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203875391|_The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell_]])) (i.e. to reject all knowledge claims apart from those that can be
deduced from their own observations and first principles known with certainty).

Such scepticism is not the starting point of this work. Our knowledge of
scientific claims, such as the charge of electrons, the speed of light in a
vacuum (and its invariance), and that massive objects attract each other with a
force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, is far
better supported than the traditional account of the justification of knowledge.
If that traditional account implies that we do not have such knowledge, then it
is the traditional account itself, and not the claims to knowledge it denies
that must be rejected. What we seek is an account of reasoning and knowledge
that is compatible with our having knowledge((or whatever positive epistemological state it is held to be, if the term <q>knowledge</q> is reserved for those beliefs justified in accordance with traditional view)) of both scientific generalisations
_and_ the principles underpinning deductive inference.

Our mere possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations does not
immediately discredit the traditional account altogether. It does show that
account to be incomplete (i.e. that some knowledge is not justified in the way
that view specifies) but it does not show that _no_ knowledge is justified in
that way. It is compatible with both the traditional account of knowledge, and
our possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations to hold that the
traditional view of knowledge is correct within some limited sphere, but that
there is also further knowledge beyond this sphere, of which it is not correct.

If the only problem posed for the traditional account of knowledge by the
growth in scientific knowledge was due to our _possession_ of knowledge that was
not justified according to the traditional account; then this view
would be tenable. In addition to knowledge deduced from first principles known
with certainty there would be knowledge justified by our observations and
scientific methods. As our scientific understanding of the physical processes
underlying perception and belief formation developed, however, it became
increasingly apparent that there was a fundamental conflict between the
_content_ of our scientific knowledge and the adequacy of the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning _even within its own sphere_.

== 2nd problem: the content of scientific theories ==
The first problem for the traditional account of knowledge was simply that we
_possess_ knowledge that is not justified by the lights of that account. The
second problem is that the _content_ of that knowledge is wildly incompatible 
with claims upon which the traditional account of reasoning and knowledge
relied.

St. Thomas Aquinas was probably the original, and certainly the most influential
author of the phrase <q>Nothing is in the mind that was not first in the
senses</q>((Or rather, of the Latin phrase of which this is the English translation; viz., <q>Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu</q>.)) but, quite fairly, he attributed the spirit of
this precept to Aristotle. It became a commonplace of medieval scholastic
philosophy, discussed by Bonaventure, Matthew of Aquasparta, and Duns Scotus.
The truth of the dictum does not directly concern us here, what does concern us
is that it makes clear the traditional commitment to our concepts being the same
as the properties presented in our sensations.  Even Plato, who held our
knowledge of the forms to be memories from a previous life in a divine realm
where we had contemplated those forms directly, also held that the poor sensible
copies presented by our senses in this world were yet close enough to spark our
remembrance of their perfect originals. Of course, philosophers being what they
are, these views are riven by further dispute. St Thomas claimed that the
<q>active intellect</q> which enabled us to grasp the universal properties
exemplified in our sensations, was an aspect of individual human intellects;
wheras his predecessors Ibn Sina held there to be just one active intellect
common to all humans, and St. Augustine considered this one common element to be
God's divine illumination. Grouping all these views under the title of <q>the
traditional account</q> is not intended to deny the profound differences between
and amongst Platonists and Aristotelians, but simply to emphasise that the
belief that that our concepts are identical with (or at least similar  to) the
properties of our sensations, was an orthodoxy amongst European and Arabic
philosophers from Aristotle up until Descartes.

According to the traditional account, not only were the properties of our
sensations the same as the concepts in our minds, they were also the properties
of the physical objects around us. As Aristotle put it:
    By a 'sense' is meant what has the power of receiving into itself the
    sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be conceived of as
    taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a
    signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that what produces the
    impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its particular metallic
    constitution makes no difference: in a similar way the sense is affected by
    what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent what in
    each case the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has
    <br>([[_De Anima_ II.12)
The colour of the distant red object is, through the light created
transparency of the intervening air, able to impress itself on the parts of
the eye that were sensitive to it. The property present in the sensitive parts
of the eye (and by which those parts are affected) is the very same as the
property of the distant object.

This triple identity, between the concepts by which we think of objects, the
forms realised without matter in our sensations, and the forms realised by the
material objects that we perceive and think of, was supposed to ensure that our
concepts _are_ the properties of the objects around us.  In Aquinas' words:
<q>The intellect, by the act of understanding, is made one with the object
understood</q>((Nam intellectus, secundum hoc quod actu intelligit, secundum hoc fit unum cum intellecto <br> [[local:zz.texts/zz.background/darcy1903.aquinasEpistemology.pdf|_Knowledge According to Aquinas_]])); or as Cajetan, a later influential commentator on Aquinas put it
<q>to know is nothing else than for the intellect to be [the thing known] and
the species is the form whereby it comes to that being.</q>(([[local:zz.texts/zz.background/darcy1903.aquinasEpistemology.pdf|_Knowledge According to Aquinas_]])) We moderns may
wonder at this somewhat mystical unity between acts of cognition and the objects
cognised((Aquinas held it to be the same unity as obtains between Jesus, the word of God, and God the father, who is the source of that word.)), and scholars continue to dispute various interpretations of
Aristotle's account of the relationships between substances, species, forms and
universals; but what is clear, in modern terms, is that the properties possessed
by the objects around us, the properties presented in our immaterial sensations
and the concepts by which we think of those objects were held to be the same.

Finally, it was because the properties we were manipulating in our imaginations,
memories and intellects were the very same as the properties instantiated by the
material objects around us, that the manipulations we could or could not perform
in thought reflected the combinations of properties that could or could not be
realised in objects outside our minds. Our minds were in direct contact with the
properties of the external world and hence reason, the capacity to abstract
those universal properties from particular instances, could give us insight
into the necessary relationships between those properties.

All of these claims were directly, unequivocally and irrefutably discredited by
scientific discoveries.

==== new understanding of the physiological processes of perception ====
The history of the collapse of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning is complicated by the fact that the traditional Aristotelian theories
of sensation and knowledge were not directly replaced by scientific theories
based upon experiment and observation, but were instead swept away by a wave of
wild armchair speculation with only a tenuous connection to empirical evidence.

At the start of the 17th century Galileo set off a wave of speculative physics
that spread over Europe. Galileo himself certainly believed a variety of
speculative theories, but his most significant discoveries were closely based on
observation and experiment.  His treatise [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidereus_Nuncius&oldid=1154096054|_The Starry Messenger_]] (1610)
contained the first report of observations of heavenly bodies made through a
telescope; and his
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&oldid=1166797169#Day_three:_Naturally_accelerated_motion|_Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences_]]((The two new sciences being static engineering [the strength of unmoving structures] and the motion of objects.)) (1638)
contained a quantitative description of the distance travelled by
<q>naturally</q> falling bodies((i.e. bodies falling solely under the influence of gravity)), namely that <q>the spaces traversed were to each
other as the squares of the times</q>((e.g. a body will fall four times as far in two seconds as it does in one)), and described measurements he had made of a
bronze ball rolling down an inclined plane that confirmed the claim. His private
notebooks also reveal a wealth of experiments, though these were downplayed in
his published work, where he tended to present his claims as deducible from
first principles.

Like Galileo's description of acceleration due to gravity, the laws Newton laid
out 80 years later in his _Mathematical principles of Natural Philosophy_ (1687)
were also quantitative and explicitly based upon experimental data.  It is
notable, however, that Newton vigourously rejected the description of his work
as <q>experimental philosophy</q> and insisted, somewhat inconstantly, that his
laws of motion were not hypotheses which he had tested against empirical
evidence, but rather regularities of nature which could simply be read off from
the empirical data he had assembled. This rejection may be more easily
understood once the range of hypotheses ventured by his contemporaries and
immediate predecessors is recognised.

In between these breakthroughs, what is striking is how little any of the
multitude of mechanistic physical theories proposed by European natural
philosophers were supported by observation or experiment. Descartes
proposed mechanistic theories concerning magnetism, the pumping of blood, the
movement of cosmological bodies, the nature of heat and the mechanism of sight,
but the only point at which he overtly based his theories upon his own
experimental observations concerned the splitting of sunlight into a spectrum by
refraction through a prism or glass ball filled with water.  Gassendi, the most
influential of the modern atomists before Boyle, ventured explanations of some
physical phenomena (such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog|sundogs]] which had been widely observed in Rome
in 1629) and noted the new visions revealed through microscopes, but he
justified his belief in discrete atoms more by references to Lucretius and the
avoidance of Zeno's paradox than any empirical observation (see
{[[timeline_of_corpuscularian_theories_of_sensation]]}).

Galileo's published works inspired generations of natural philosophers to reject
any but mechanistic theories. Theories in which physical phenomena were
explained purely in terms of the size, shape and motion of bodies acting on each
other only through direct contact.  In Hobbes words:
    as for those that say any thing may be moved or produced by it Self, by
    Species, by its own Power, by Substantial Forms, by Incorporeal Substances,
    by Instinct, by Anteperistasis, by Antipathy, Sympathy, Occult Quality, and
    other empty words of Schoolmen, their saying so is to no purpose.<br>
    (_Elements of Philosophy_ 1656)
But Galileo's influence did not cure those natural philosophers of their
speculative tendencies, nor of their general preference for armchair theorizing
over menial laboratory experiments.  Indeed, as good constraints often do, the
constraints on mechanistic theories caused creative speculation to flourish.

The bodily mechanisms involved in movement and sensation were a particularly
attractive topic of speculation. Galileo had realised from the outset that if
mechanistic theories were to be plausible they would have to explain our
sensations of colour, taste and scent as arising from mechanical interactions
between the external bodies and our sensory organs.  Indeed this was the main
focus of his 1623 work [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assayer|_The Assayer_]]:
    from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to inhere, these
    tastes, odors, colors, etc., are nothing but empty names; rather they inhere
    only in the sensitive body, such that if one removes the animal, then all
    these qualities are taken away and annihilated.
Even if the eventual sensations that these processes led up to were, as
Descartes held, non-physical, an account of the external bodies that travelled
from distant objects to our sensory organs was required, together with an
account of how those bodies interacted with the sensory organs and of the
mechanisms by which signals were conveyed from those organs to the brain or
heart or wherever else the locus of interactions between body and mind was held
to be.

Hobbes explicitly exemplified both these tendencies, holding both that the
principles of mechanical physics could be demonstratively deduced from the
definitions of the terms <q>body</q>, <q>motion</q> and <q>cause</q> and hence
did not need to be established by experiment and observation; and also that
<q>The cause of Sense is the Externall Body, or Object, which presseth the organ
proper to each Sense, .  . . which pressure, by the mediation of the Nerves, and
other strings, and membranes of the body, continued inwards to the Brain and
Heart</q>((_Leviathan_)).

As history turned out, it was muscular movements, rather than sensory signals,
that received the lion's share of attention and were the subject of the first
breakthroughs. Here, as with gravity, it was compressive or attractive forces
that proved most difficult to explain in terms of mechanistic interactions.
Indeed, the lack of any plausible mechanism for muscular contractions had led
Descartes to reject Harvey's claim that the blood was pumped by contractions of
the heart, though he accepted the rest of Harvey's theory of blood circulation.
These difficulties aroused a great deal of curiosity about muscular movements
and are one of the reasons why Galvani and Volta's discovery in 1800 that
electrical currents could cause muscles to contract, was immediately regarded as
momentous.

Eventually, of course, the wild speculations of the early mechanists gave way
to well supported theories. Though it was not until 1950 that Hodgkins
and Huxley described the processes by which neurons built up electric voltage
differences and propagated changes in that voltage from axon's to dendrites by
means of the selective permeability of cell membranes. Even today we still do
not have a definitive account of these processes, with some current researchers
contending that nerve impulses are not purely electrical but have a mechanical
component after all (see [[https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2019.00208|Thinking About the Nerve Impulse: The Prospects for the Development of a Comprehensive Account of Nerve Impulse Propagation]], 2019)

In any case, it is clear that many people now _know_, what mechanistic natural
philosophers such as Galileo, Descartes and Hobbes may have only _believed_,
viz., that the surfaces of well lit middle sized objects such as tables and
chairs are radically different to the streams of particles travelling from those
surfaces to our eyes, which are again radically different to what happens at the
backs of our eyes as they are stuck by those particles, which is again radically
different to the impulses sent from our eyes to parts of the brain, which is
again different from the activity in our brains (and if that gives rise to
mental entities or properties such as qualia or sensations then those are yet
different again).

When these beliefs were transmuted into knowledge (if indeed
there is any such point in the life of any individual or community) need not
concern us here.  Whether the theories of mechanistic natural philosophers
are applauded as the best explanations of physiological processes of sensation
and bodily movement available at the time; or derided as restricted to an
implausibly austere range of fundamental interactions too limited to do justice
to either human behaviour or natal phenomena; speculative belief in mechanistic theories
eventually led to and was replaced by belief in the well supported empirical
theories of modern science.  The empirical successes of those theories has
irretrivably shattered the illusion that our minds have anything remotely
describable as direct contact with the properties of the objects around us. The
loss of that illusion takes with it the traditional account of reasoning that
had explained our capacity for insight into the modal relationships between the
properties of the objects around us.

Unlike the [[#1st problem: the justification of scientific theories|first problem]], which merely implied that the traditional account of
knowledge and reasoning was incomplete, the new discoveries about the
physiological processes underpinning sensation are outright incompatible with
the traditional account. If the properties of our sensations and thoughts are
not the same as the properties of the objects they represent then the
traditional account of knowledge is false. In particular, the traditional
explanation of the consonance between the properties we can combine <q>in the
intellect</q> and the combinations of properties that external objects can
realise collapses.

The incompatibility of the new understanding of the physiological processes
underpinning sensation with the ancient account of knowledge and reasoning does
not compel scepticism about our ability to reason. Even if the
traditional account is false and we have no better alternative to offer in its
place, that does not imply that we cannot distinguish good from bad reasoning,
nor that we cannot reason our way to justified beliefs, but only that we are
ignorant of how we have these abilities. The lack of a plausible epistemological
theory no more casts doubt on our capacity to reason than ignorance of the
physiology of the eye casts doubt on our ability to see. However, in both cases
a deeper understanding of the processes involved can give greater insight into
when they are liable to go wrong, and make us more able to spot charlatans; and
in neither case is the naive account of how these processes function or what
they reveal to us beyond question.

There is, however, a yet more fundamental aspect of the conflict between our
understanding of ourselves as creatures whose physiology obeys the same physical
principles as the rest of the natural world, and our understanding of ourselves
as reasoning beings that does threaten scepticism.

==== insensitive to necessity and possibility ====
With the doubtful exception of quantum mechanics, all the objects described in
our scientific theories are utterly unresponsive to mere possibilities. The
moving bodies postulated in both Newtonian mechanics and general relativity
alter their velocity only in response to actual forces such as the impact of
another object, the influence of a magnetic field or of gravitation.  The mere
possibility that an object might be struck or the possibility of magnetic flux
has no effect upon such bodies whatsoever.

In reasoning, at least as it has been understood in the European philosophical
tradition since the time of the ancient Greeks till today, we appear to have
access to truths concerning possibility and necessity. Reason reveals to us not
only that each triangle's internal angles sum to two right angles, but that
they _must_ do so. On the other hand, the merest possibility of rain tomorrow
may motivate us to take an umbrella.  The latter may be explicable as a mere
appearance. The apparent influence of a future possibility may, upon further
reflection, be attributed to the effect of various actual objects and events
present and past; the looming of dark clouds, the weather reporter's confident
assertion that it will rain and so on. In the case of our ability to reason,
however, our sensitivity to modal truths is not so easily dismissed.  An
argument is valid just in case it is impossible for its premises to be true and
its conclusion false; and reasoning is supposed, amongst other things, to enable
us to distinguish valid from invalid arguments.

In our reasoning capacities we appear to display a sensitivity to possibility
and necessity that is unlike any of the objects revealed to us by scientific
enquiry. It thus seems impossible for reasoning beings such as ourselves to
be made from the modally insensitive materials postulated in science.

== knowledge of necessary truths became the central problem of philosophy ==
Initially, it was the first of these two problems that appeared most pressing
and received the greatest attention.  As awareness of these problems spread,
however, there was an inversion in where the center of the epistemological
difficulties was supposed to lie and the second problem came to be seen as more
critical.

At first the chief difficulty was thought to be our knowledge of contingent
external objects via the senses and it was the nature of the justification of
that knowledge that received the most attention. [[descartes|Descartes']] concern was
that the senses are dubious and he sought to show why and under what
circumstances they warranted absolute confidence.  By contrast, he
took our knowledge of truths of mathematics, and of truths underpinning valid
arguments such as his cogito to be induibitable((Descartes is inconstant on this point. Sometimes he asserts that it is within God's power to deceive us even about such truths.  This even engenders a well known circularity in Descartes' arguments.  But God's power to deceive us about such truths remains an afterthought for Descartes, intended to ensure compatibility with God's omnipotence. By contrast, the main conclusion of the cogito is that we can trust the senses only because the existence of a God who does not deceive us can be _deduced_ from the certain knowledge of one's own existence and thoughts)):
    let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am
    nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something; or make it true at
    some future time that I have never existed, since it is now true that I
    exist; or bring it about that two and three added together are more or less
    than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction.
    <br>([[local:zz.texts/descartes2.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|Third Meditation]])
Descartes' reconciliation of the traditional account of knowledge with our
knowledge of scientific theories was never widely accepted. Instead, eventually,
the traditional account of the justification of knowledge by experience was
rejected. Though elements of the traditional view lingered long in the
shadowy corners of our languages and intuitions, when considered directly and
explicitly, scientific principles were simply no longer held to be necessarily
true first principles nor deducible from them.

According to the developing scientific theories, the casual connections
between external objects and our experiences were not necessary, nor did they
simply imprint the properties of external objects onto our sensations.
Nevertheless, it was still accepted that that there were, at least when things
went well, causal chains running from external objects, via experiences, to the
formation of beliefs true of those objects.  Once attempts to tighten the links
in these chains sufficiently to satisfy the traditional account of knowledge
were abandoned, less stringent standards of knowledge were proposed(([[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Nozick&oldid=1172878738#Epistemology|Nozick]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_Williamson&oldid=1166387750#Philosophical_work|Williamson]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duncan_Pritchard&oldid=1036160614#Academic_studies|Pritchard's]] proposals are currently the best known.)) that chains
of contingent causation could support (some with less stringent standards of
necessity to go with them((<q>safety is a sort of local necessity</q> - Williamson, [[https://www.amherstlecture.org/williamson2009/|_Probability and Danger_]], 2009)) ). Of course none of these alternatives was quite
the same as the full strength original, and enthusiastic discussion of their
various shortcomings continues to this day. Doubtful philosophers continued,
however, to find solace in the causal connections between our beliefs and the
objects of which those beliefs were true. According to our best scientific
theories, the empirical evidence which justifies our beliefs in contingent
truths, whether that is other beliefs, experiences, stimuli, tracks in the sand
or noises in the distance, can affect the formation of our beliefs.  Hence it
seems possible for creatures displaying roughly our level of success in holding
only justified beliefs and assessing the justifications of others' beliefs, to
be constructed from the natural materials described by science.  Although it was
only slowly and reluctantly accepted that our knowledge of contingent truths,
such as those comprising our scientific theories was not justified in the way
specified by the traditional account of knowledge, and the details of just how
our experiences justified that knowledge are still disputed, there did not
appear to be a fundamental conflict between our possession of such knowledge and
our scientific understanding of the world.

By contrast, the incompatibility between our scientific theories and our
apparent knowledge of necessarily truths (and capacituy for deductive reasoning)
appeared both more pressing and more irresolvable as time passed. Our capacity
to gain knowledge of necessary truths seemed both indispensable to and
incompatible with our scientific discoveries. One difficulty is that many
necessary truths (such as those of arithmetic and geometry) appear to refer to
objects that are not located in space and time, which are hence incapable of
playing any part in causing the formation of beliefs about them((In the more recent philosophical literature this is sometimes called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Benacerraf&oldid=1172032726#Philosophical_work|Benecerraf's epistemological problem or Beneceraff's dilemma]] )).
Another apparent difficulty is
that, despite our frequent errors in reasoning, we appear to be justified in
believing some necessary truths with absolute certainty. But any causal
psychological process by which confidence is produced will be subject to
malfunctioning and hence though it may produce a _feeling_ of absolute certainty
(or at least a feeling that we customarily describe as a feeling of absolute
certainty) absolute certainty could never be justified by any causal
psychological process((The point is roughly Hume's, though he draws from this claim the conclusion that we can never have any confidence in our judgements at all:<q>In every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well as concerning knowledge, we ought always to correct the first judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the object, by another judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the understanding. ’Tis certain a man of solid sense and long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire; since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and must still dread the like for the future.</q> [[hume1739.treatiseHumanNature.pdf|_Treatise of Human Nature_]])). More generally, as noted above, the objects described
in scientific theories appear to be utterly insensitive to modal relations. As
[[hume|Hume]] pointed out vigourously and to great effect, the supposedly
necessary connexions between causes and their effects do not, themselves, cause
any experiences in us (or cause our beliefs to change by other means).

The problem is not merely that terms such as <q>knowledge</q> and <q>justification</q>
cannot be translated into the terminology of physics or some other science
(though such a translation would provide a conclusive solution to the
problem).  The term <q>bridge</q> may be untranslatable into the language of
physics((One problem is vagueness and borderline cases. Is an ant-bridge a bridge?  A tree that falls across a river but rots away without any creature crossing over it? Another is the seemingly infinitely diverse ways in which bridges might be constructed of physical materials [unless there is some maximum size for bridges].)), but the capacity of some particular bridge to bear a load
of a million tons or survive a one-in-a-hundred-year earthquake is explicable in
purely physical terms. As some current philosophers are wont to say, the
features that make something a useable bridge are _grounded_ by its
physical properties.  There appears to be no such hope of grounding our
sensitivity to modal properties and relations in the physical properties of the
materials from which, according to our current best scientific theories, our
brains and bodies are constructed. Just as it seems impossible to construct a
device for detecting magnetic fields purely from materials utterly unaffected by
magnetism, so too it seems impossible for creatures such we appear to be,
capable of distinguishing necessary from contingent truths (and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soundness&oldid=1133515087|sound arguments]]
from arguments that merely happen to have true premises and conclusions) to be
constructed from materials that are utterly unaffected by modal relationships
and properties.

Appearing initially as a felt need for a guarantee of correspondence between
our concepts and the properties they represent (the starting point for the
traditional account of our capacity to reason) the conflict between our
understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings sensitive to modal connections,
and the scientific understanding of ourselves as physical systems constructed
from modally insensitive materials, became the central problem of modern
philosophy.

=== central to analytic and kantian philosophy ===
Largely as a result of repeated failures to resolve this very conflict,


this very conflict, the current philosophical zeitgeist is inimical to any claim
that philosophy _has_ a central problem.
s a result the claim that philosophy has 
Not only have these repeated failures
led many to become pessimistic about the prospects of any grand
philosophical project, but one of the further effects of these failures has been
to cast doubt over whether philosophical problems (like questions and
propositions) are the sorts of that can be sharply distinguished at all. For
this or other reasons it may well be impossible to distinguish philosophical
problems and rank their <q>centrality</q> on the basis of their semantic or
logical relations.  Even if this is so, however, it is still coherent to speak
of doctrines as central to philosophical _movements_, and to describe the
dominance of philosophical movements in the philosophy of their culture. In
particular, it is coherent to claim that accounts of our knowledge of necessary
truths were the central unifying doctrines of both the dominant movements of
modern Anglo-European philosophy.

Since the 12th century just three movements of Anglo-European philosophy
have achieved such dominance as to be the orthodoxies of their
day. The first of these was the more or less Aristotelian movement which
included most Scholastics and many other influential late Medieval philosophers.
The second was founded by Kant and its members were those whose
views were developments, directly or indirectly, of the views expressed in
Kant's works, most notably those of his [[local:zz.texts/kant1787.critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_]].
The third was Analytic philosophy whose title, unlike the first two, was coined
by its own members and overtly reflected their common commitment to <q>analysis</q>
as the only fundamental means by which knowledge of necessary truths could be
justified((There are, of course, derivative means, such as being told that a given truth is necessarily true by a source that has conducted such analysis but, according to the central doctrines of analytic phuilosophy all chains of such derivative justifications terminate, eventually, in analysis.)). These movements were not orthodoxies merely because they each had,
at the height of their popularity, a majority of the then living European
langauge speaking philosophers as members (though it is plausible they did). Nor
were the central doctrines of these movements central by virtue of being
espoused by all their members. But engaging with these movements' central
doctrines was a reliable method of making one's work accessible to other
philosophers.  Philosophers who were not at least aware of these doctrines were
regarded as iconoclasts or niche specialists. In roughly the terms of one
suggested method of explicating vague terms such as <q>analytic philosopher</q>
(for the explication of vague terms is itself a contentious philosophical issue)
these movements' paradigmatic members (figures such as Aristotle, Kant, Frege
and Russell) explicitly espoused versions of their movement's central doctrines
and other philosophers were, in large part, held to be members of those
movements to the extent that they accepted doctrines resembling those
paradigmatic examples and engaged with those doctrines and the claims of their
movement's other members.

Both members and opponents of Kantianism and Analytic philosophy took the
accounts of knowledge of necessary truths offered by those movements'
pre-eminent members to be those movements unifying theses.  It was commonly
recognised that those movements' mainstream members often claimed those theses
had fundamental implications for philosophical methodology, sought to describe
methods consonant with those theses and sometimes even attempted to apply them.
In Kant's words:
    Much is gained already when we can bring a multitude of inquiries under the
    formula of a single problem. For we thereby facilitate not only our own
    business by defining it precisely, but also-for anyone else who wants to
    examine it-the judgment as to whether or not we have carried out our project
    adequately. Now the proper problem of pure reason is contained in this
    question: How are _a priori_ synthetic judgments possible?
    <br>([[local:zz.texts/kant1787.critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_]])
While this quote does support the claim that Kant and his followers believed
there was a single question which it was the chief business to answer, and
by which Kant assessed why



make it clear that Kant thought there was a singular question of pure reason
(and hence of philsoop[hy) and it was by the adequacy of his answer to this
question that his [hilosophy was to be judged, it is not clear

that philosophy did have _a_ central question 
At first reading it may not be clear that this quote supports the claim that the
question of how Kant's question of claim supports
The reason Kant took the question of the justification of _a priori_ synthetic
knowledge(/justified judgements) to be *the* singular question of pure reason
(and hence *the* question of philosophy) was because he thought it would provide
a standard by which the answers to all other _a priori_ questions may be
assessed. Once his supposed critique of pure reason had been successfully
deliniated, he held that one would only need to apply that critique to the
putative justification of any _a priori_ claim to determine whether that
justification was good (thus philosophical speculation would be reined in and
philosophical disputes put on <q>firm ground</q>).

At first glance it may not be clear that Kant's question <q>How are _a pri
There are two salient differences between Kant's claim and our claim that
providing an account of our knowledge of necessary truths was the central task
of modern philosophy. The first is that Kant identified the problematic class of
judgements as _a priori_, knowable without or prior to to aid of experience,
rather than as necessary truths. This difference, however, is merely superficial
since Kant also took all necessary truths to be _a priori_ (<q>if we find a
proposition such that in thinking it we think at the same time its necessity,
then it is an _a priori_ judgment</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787.critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_]])) ) and all _a priori_ truths to be necessary.
His reason for describing these truths as _a priori_ rather than necessary
(since on his view these two classes of truths were the same) was to emphasise
that the problem was to provide an account of how some beliefs could be
justified without the aid of experience. At least by his lights, however, this
difference is merely terminological.

The second difference is that Kant claimed it was only our knowledge of
_synthetic_ necessary truths justification posed a problem for philosophy. In
addition to _synthetic_ necessary truths, Kant held there to be other necessary
truths, non-synthetic (or as he called them <q>analytic</q>((Original German: <q>analytischer</q>))) necessary truths whose
justification was not part of the <q>the proper problem of pure reason</q>. But
Kant thought it was only the explanation of our knowledge of _synthetic_
necessary truths that was <q>the proper problem of pure reason</q> because he
believed we already had a perfectly satisfactory account of our knowledge of
non-synthetic necessary truths.  Analytic truths, according to Kant, were truths
in which <q>the predicate belongs to the subject as something that is (covertly)
within it</q>((Original text:<q>the predicate B belongs to the subject A as something that is covertly contained in this concept A</q> (The labels A and B are introduced solely for the purpose of confusing the subject with the concept representing that subject). [[local:zz.texts/kant1787.critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_ ]])) , a relationship to which he supposed we had epistemic access.
Whether or not this account of our knowledge of analytic truths is plausible we
shall consider later, but it is clear that Kant accepted this account and
thought that if he could also explain our knowledge of synthetic necessary
truths he would thereby have a complete account of how all our knowledge of
necessary truths was, in principle, justified. Hence, Kant's assertion supports
our claim that he, and of course philosophers heavily influenced by him, took
providing an account of the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths
to be the central task of their philosophy (even though they thought there was
already a satisfactory account of the justification of our knowledge of _some_
necessary truths - viz., the analytic ones).

For their part, early Analytic philosophers thought Kant's account of
_analyticity_, which had relied upon traditional Aristotelian theories of
semantics((This is discussed in more detail [[????|below]])), was too limited.  A range of technical developments in formal logic
had made it plausible that the class of analytic truths included statements of a
variety and complexity that had previously seemed impossible. In light of these
developments Analytic philosophers hoped Kant's account of our knowledge of
analytic truths could be expanded and developed into an account of all
our knowledge of necessary truths. Although disputes over various accounts of
analyticity and the nature of the objects to be analysed were among the
movement's main activities((it was commonly agreed that these objects either were or were related to the meanings of linguistic expressions)), in the movement's early optimistic period its
members were at least superficially unified by a general commitment to the maxim
<q>All necessary truths are analytic</q>.

Like the Kantian philosophers before them, Analytic philosophers thought their
account of our knowledge of necessary truths had profound import for
philosophical practice. They held themselves to be practicing a form of
philosophy distinctively different to those that had come before; a form in
which philosophical/logical/conceptual (to name just a few of the options)
_analysis_ was the only fundamental method by which knowledge of necessary truths
could be justified. Hence the self-applied title of of <q>*Analytic*
philosophy</q>.

Finally, doctrines concerning our capacity to have knowledge of necessary
truths, were also central to these two movements in the simple sense that their
popularity depended upon them. Both movements grew while their accounts of our
knowledge of necessary truths seemed plausible, and began to disintegrate once
those accounts were discredited. Each continued for a time to be held together
by stylistic and sociological factors borne out of a common tradition.  Neither
collapsed immediately, they continued for a time to be held together by
stylistic and sociological factors borne out of a common tradition. However,
without a central unifying approach to explaining the foundations of our
knowledge of necessary truths, their members' senses of what constituted good
philosophical work gradually drifted apart and over time they fell into a range
of schools and factions which had increasingly little in common.

Galileo published [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&oldid=1166797169#Day_three:_Naturally_accelerated_motion|_Two New Sciences_]] in 1632.  Since then, no other
philosophical movements have come remotely close to exercising the same
dominance over Anglo-European that Kantian and Analytic philosophy each once
held. Both of those two movements were centered around attempts to resolve the
apparent incompatibility between the new scientific theories and traditional
accounts of our capacity to reason and our sensitivity to modal connections. In
this admittedly vague sociological sense, providing an account of our knowledge
of necessary truths was the central task of modern philosophy.

=== Two Reasons for focus ===
Although we have only been able to make sense of the notion of a problem being
_central to philosophy_ in the vague historical or sociological sense just
outlined, the centrality of the problem of the justification of knowledge of
necessary truths was not a historical accident or passing fashion.
Many modern philosophers had, or at least took themselves to have, good
_reasons_ for focusing their efforts on attempting to explain our knowledge of
necessary truths.  This is itself a manifestation of the very conflict
that we are beginning to investigate, for here the apparent causal effects of
our sensitivity to reasons are writ large on human history.

Though we are not yet in a position to venture any account of how this
sensitivity to reasons causally interacts with our actions, nor of why some
reasons seem deeper or more profound than others, that should not prevent us
from attempting to describe the reasons that many modern philosophers gave for
focusing on this problem.

The distinction between one reason and another 

There are, of course, a multitude of reasons different philosophers have
had for focusing on attempting to explain our knowledge of necessary truths
there are two that stand out above all others. Partly 


==== solid foundations for philosophy ====

The first reason


This is not deductive reasoning, thus far we have hinted as reasoning as a
matter of seeig that if one statement is true then another necessary follows
from it, the first reason that pre-eminent was teleological.  This is not reason
in the sense that A is a reason to believe B because <q>If A then B</q> is a necessary
truth but the sense in which Ailisha's 

every possible world

One of the reasons that many modern philosophers had for believing the task of
explaining our knowledge of necessary truths to be critically important, was
that they thought philosophy, like geometry and mathematics, was a field in
which knowledge was produced by reasoning unaided by the senses((Kant's term is <q>pure reason</q>.  In German: <q>reinen Vernuft</q>)); and that
reason alone could only produce knowledge of necessary truths (as per the
traditional account of reasoning). Unlike mathematics, however, philosophy was
awash with a range of seemingly irresolvable disputes. Many philosophers
hoped that a successful account of how reasoning can justify
belief in necessary truths would put all other philosophical arguments on firm
ground. Perhaps as an account of the mechanism of sight may help to distinguish
accurate visions from hallucinations, so too an account of our knowledge of
necessary truths could help distinguish good reasoning from bad and permit the
resolution of philosophical disputes (indeed it seems reasonable to expect such
a critique of pure reason to be more helpful bec.

Thus far 

but more helpful than the case of sight since there would be no varying
contingent external world to take into account).

only on his second attempt, we may attribute to his realising that this was
clearer and more, rather than it being an afterthought.)) ):

At first glance this concern with putting philosophy <q>on a firm footing</q>
may appear purely parochial. After all it is easy to see what philosophers stand
to gain by putting their house in order
If

It is easy to see why philosophers' might seek to put their house in
order. Many modern philosophers believe, as [[local:zz.texts/zz.papersAfter1960/daly2017.persistentPhilosophicalDisagreement.pdf|Chris Daly (2017)]] puts it, that
<q>there are two awkward facts about philosophy.  First, no philosophical
problems have been solved; second, philosophers cannot agree about anything
beyond that. The contrast with the natural sciences is then evident: many
scientific problems have been solved, and there is appreciable agreement between
scientists in scientific matters</q>. 

One obvious motivation being to gain the same trust and respect from the general
public for their profession claims as is given to those of mathematicians and
scientists.

But one does not need to be so cynical as to assume that this is the only
reason. Many philosophers genuinely care about knowling the truth 
Many philosophers genuinely


But the problem is not merely parochial; the
question of how our capacity to reason can be so productive of certain knowledge
in mathematics and logic, and provide support to the knowledge claims of scientists
but be incapable of resolving philosophical disputes 

Of course even clearly supported scientific claims, such as climate change, 

It may be that many philosophical questions are meaningless pseudo-questions,
while others are meaningful but concern matters of which we can have
no knowledge. If all, or nearly all, philosophical issues had to be simply put
aside as irressolvable that may be disappointing to those who have spent a great
deal of their lives


to attempt to demarcate between the knowable statements of mathematics, logic
and science from the unknowable pseudo-statements of philosophy and other fields
of groundless speculation.

In any case the benefits of such a clear account of good reasoning would be
expected beyond the realm of 



This first reason may have been compelling to philosophers who sought
a way of resolving their interminable disputes, but to those who were not
already invested in evaluating philosophical claims it could be easily avoided
by simply dismissing philosophy as a whole as a source of knowledge. (This is
the course espoused by current popular scientists such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Krauss&oldid=1171153707#|Laurence Krauss]] and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&oldid=1178289515#Philosophy|Neil Degrass Tyson]].) Many philosophers however, had a second, less parochial
reason for holding the explanation of our knowledge of necessary truths to be a
fundmental problem that could neither be avoided nor resolved by scientific
investigation.

= some necessary truths indispensible to scientific theories =
Namely, that scientific theories contained necessary truths,
most conspicuously those of mathematics and logic, in which belief could not be
justifed by scientific means.

Scientific theories seem to involve necessary truths in another way
more broadly the connection between theories and the evidence that would confirm
or infirm those theories appears to be necessary.

As many philosophers continue to note, the relationship between science and
philosophy is unlike that between modern chemistry and alchemy. Medieval
alchemists may have possessed some knowledge of chemical properties and
reactions buried amongst their superstitions and esoteric theories, but alchemy
has been altogether superseded by chemistry.  The methods and principles of
alchemy have been either rejected or justified by means entirely within the
field of chemistry, leaving no residual core of alchemical principles which
modern chemistry relies upon but cannot justify. By contrast, modern science
retains, on this view, a reliance upon principles supposedly discovered by
the unscientific methods of ancient philosophers((One of the more concrete problems with this history is that the full range of logical techniques required in mathematical reasoning was only first adequately and rigourously described in 1879 by Frege)). Most obvious are the truths
of mathematics and logic, which feature explicitly in scientific theories. More
broadly, however, the relationship between scientific theories and the evidence
for them appears not to be itself a matter for scientific investigation.
Whether a scientific principle or theory is supported by a given range of
evidence at least appears not to be discoverable by scientific empirical
investigation; though of course whether that evidence happens to exist is. So it
is that within a limited sphere that includes at least algebra, geometry and
deductive logic, our knowledge of necessary truths remains indispensible to
modern scientific theories and yet apparently unjustifiable by scientific
methods.

The continued dependence of science upon apparently unscientific deductive
principles led many philosophers((Kant is, again, the exemplar, but there is no shortage of others who have followed his lead; both wittingly and unwittingly.)) to claim that the success
of science in producing knowledge can _only_ show that the traditional account
of the justification of knowledge is incomplete, and never that it is altogether
wrong, on the grounds that science cannot altogether undermine the unscientific
source of knowledge discerned by ancient philosophers without undermining
itself.  That philosophers might find this claim appealing is easily understood,
for it neatly defends the continued relevance and value of philosophical
enquiries to actual knowledge production and tacitly establishes philosophy as
the queen of the sciences, standing in judgement over all the rest.

The conclusion that many philosophers have drawn from this seeming impasse is
??-one of pleasing syncretism-??
On the one hand, the traditional acocunt of knowledge cannot be complete, since
it is not true of our knowledge of scientific principles. On the other hand
scientific theories must be incomplete since they rely upon

this pleasing syncretism

Despite its
appeal, however, this comforting pablum has two serious defects. It relies upon
the dubious assumption that the traditional account is the only((or at least the best, though in practice alternatives are almost never considered)) explanation
of our knowledge of the truths of geometry, mathematics and logic etc., upon
which scientific theories continue to rely; and it ignores the depth of the
conflict between the traditional account and the _content_ of our scientific
theories.

mathematics gained by reasoning was viewed as the best most certain

mathematics was the science of distance measurement and like other sciences

approached the problem more explicitly, denying that the truths of mathematics
were necessary, and claiming that universal claims (such as <q>All men are
mortal</q> or <q>Each triangles angles sum to two right angles</q>) were mere
reminders of a justified commitment to making real inferences from past
particular observations

Attempts were made to avoid this problem. J.S. Mill, for instance, denied that
the truths of mathematics were necessary at all. Holding instead that held that
all <q>real</q> inferences were from particulars to particulars, and that
universal claims (e.g. <q>All men are mortal</q> or <q>All triangles have
internal angles that sum to 180 degrees</q>) were mere reminders of our
justified commitment to making such inferences (e.g. infering from particular
past observations of humans dying that a particular newly observed human will

Viewed upon a larger scale, the new focus on the justification of knowledge of
necessary truths was a reversion to the ancient order.  Explaining our knowledge
of necessary truths, whether of mathematics, physics or biology, was the central
goal of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning. Not because the
ancient proponents of the traditional view thought the empirical justification
of knowledge of contingent truths was straightforward, but because they held
certain knowledge of necessary truths to be the only sort of knowledge worth
considering.

Whether the modern attempts to explain the justification of the knowledge of
necessary truths is regarded as a new response to an unprecedented crisis
created by the mismatch between scientific discoveries and the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning, or as the continuation of an ancient
enquiry; the manifest falsehood of traditional epistemology left us without any
coherent account of the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths, and
the search for such an account became the central task of modern philosophy.


== early modern accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths ==
==== descartes ====
????
[[descartes|Descartes]] broadened the traditional account of knowledge by allowing contingent
truths known with certainty (such as knowledge of one's own existence and
immediate experiences) to serve as first principles in addition to necessary
truths known with certainty (such as the postulates of geometry). He then
attempted to show all knowledge, including both mathematical and scientific
knowledge, could be deduced from those expanded foundations. He did not,
however, venture an account of our ability to gain knowledge of those necessary
first principles beyond describing it as <q>seeing by the clear light of
reason</q> and attributing our possession of it to God's grace. This is not to
criticise Descartes for taking this ability for granted, but simply to note
that his objective in works such as
[[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason_]] and
[[local:zz.texts/descartes2.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Meditations on First Philosophy_]]
was not to explain our knowledge of necessary truths and necessarily truth
preserving arguments, but to to show that from that knowledge, together with
certain knowledge of our own existence and experiences, everything else we know
could be deduced.
????
In his [[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Rules for the Direction of Mind_]] and
[[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason_]], [[Descartes]]
confidently claims to describe a method for <q>seeking truth in the sciences</q>
(including mathematics) that will <q>gradually and constantly increase one’s
knowledge till one arrives at a true understanding of everything within one’s
capacity</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Rules for the Direction of Mind_]])). His promises, however, do not stand up to close inspection.
His descriptions of his <q>method</q> amount to little more than pieces of
general advice on how to approach scientific and mathematical problems; along
the lines of *take nothing for granted*, and *divide problems into smaller parts*.
While these tips can be helpful, Descartes himself acknowledges that the
description of his method does not amount to an account of our capacity to
reason: <q>The method cannot go so far as to teach us how to perform the actual
operations of intuition and deduction, since these are the simplest of all and
quite basic. If our intellect were not already able to perform them, it would
not comprehend any of the rules of the method, however easy they might
be.</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Rules for the Direction of Mind_]]))

Although Descartes does not propose to explain our knowledge of necessary
truths, he does outline prototypical versions of two distinctions that later
philosophers will rely upon in their attempts to explain such knowledge:

The first of these distinctions is between *simple* and *complex* necessary truths.
Simple truths are known as soon as they are clearly considered (by those who
possess <q>some degree of rationality</q>) and no further justification for our
knowledge of them can be given or required. Knowledge of complex truths, by
contrast, requires reasoning for its justification. Reason, on this view, being
the ability to devise, or at least inspect, chains of simple inferences whereby
complex truths may be deduced from truths known with certainty - either
necessary first principles or infallible statements of one's own experiences.

According to Descartes there are <q>simple natures</q> whose
distinguishing feature is being known <q>so clearly and distinctly that they
cannot be divided by the mind into others which are more distinctly known</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]])).
Descartes' examples of such simple natures include properties such as
shape, extension, motion, existence, unity and duration, as well as principles
of Euclidean geometry such as <q>Things that are the same as a third thing are
the same as each other</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]])), and concepts of small integers such as seven.
Sometimes Descartes claims these simple natures are mental entities such as
concepts or ideas, while at other times he says that they are properties of
objects (and at yet others he warns against assuming that our concepts are the 
same as the properties of external objects((<q>the understanding of the wise man will not be deceived in such cases: while he will judge that whatever comes to him from his imagination really is depicted in it, he will never assert that it passes, complete and unaltered, from the external world to his senses, and from his senses to the corporeal imagination, unless he already has some other grounds for claiming to know this.</q>, [[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]]))).  In any case, once these simple
natures are distinguished no error of judgement can be made about them, nor can
our knowledge of them be less than complete. Any rational person simply sees the
modal relationships between these simples by <q>the clear light of reason</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]]))
and hence, once their attention is drawn to them, knows if simple principles
are necessarily true or whether it is necessary, possible or impossible for
an object to possess combinations of simple properties.

It would be a mistake to imagine that Descartes had a coherent, but poorly
expressed, account of simples, which might be unearthed by careful
interpretation of his writing. Rather, whenever Descartes finds a principle
which strikes him as clearly and obviously true, but for which he is unable to
provide a justification((When, in Wittgenstein's much later metaphor, he <q>hits bedrock</q>.)) he simply declares it to be simple or concern a
relationship between simple properties. The appeal to simplicity is an attempt
to explain the phenomena - how can one have clear and certain knowledge of
principles for which one can provide no further justification. The explanation
is that those principles are just too simple for there to be any doubt.  Without
an independent account of simplicity, however, this explanation is vacuous and
the <q>method</q> of reducing complicated propositions to simpler ones (the
fifth of the _Rules for Direction of Mind_) amounts to the practical but
somewhat vague advice to break things down into obvious steps, rather than a
principled account of how knowledge of necessary truths is justified. In the
end, Descartes offers no account of our knowledge of simple truths except for
God's grace, and no method for identifying them except that they seem clear and
obvious.

Descartes' writing also contains occasional hints of a distinction that
later philosophers would draw between contentive truths and empty or merely
verbal truths. Though Descartes does not draw a distinction between sorts of
truths along these lines, he does apply a similar distinction to some forms of
inference.  In particular, he criticises Aristotelian syllogisms on the grounds
that we <q>learn nothing new from such forms of reasoning</q>, saying
<q>dialecticians are unable to formulate a syllogism with a true conclusion
unless they are already in possession of the substance of the conclusion</q>.
Although Descartes does not develop the distinction further, it is worth
noting that a precursor of this distinction, which would eventually become
central to accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths, is already present at
this early stage.

Descartes produced his works prior to the epistemological inversion noted at the
end of the [[#knowledge of necessary truths became the central problem of philosophy|last section]]. His focus is on the truths we may discover by the
application of our ability to reason rather than the nature of that ability
itself. Like the Aristotelian philosophers who preceeded him, he maintained that
all knowledge was deduced from principles known with certainty. Unlike
Aristotle, he took such principles to include both knowledge of necessary first
principles and knowledge of one's own experiences. The chief epistemological
problem he attempted to solve was how to deduce our scientific theories from
such certainties, and thereby place them on the same secure foundations as our
knowledge of mathematics and geometry. He had faith enough in God, confidence
enough in his own abilities, and was so strongly struck by the sense of
<q>seeing clearly</q> that something must be so, that it apparently never
occured to him to venture an account of the foundations of our ability to reason
beyond attributing it to God's grace. 

==== locke ====
Locke's account of our ability to reason in his
[[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|_Essay Concerning Human Understanding_]] is, in many ways, merely a
more refined and systematic version of Descartes'. Like Descartes, he
distinguishes between simple and complex truths, and holds that simple truths
<q>as soon as understood, are, without any the least reasoning, embraced and
assented to</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).  Locke is more careful than Descartes to distinguish mental
entities - <q>ideas</q> - from the properties they represent. He makes it clear that
his simples are ideas, and that necessary simple truths express <q>relations
between ideas</q>.  He goes to considerable lengths to emphasize that these ideas
are not innate, but impressed upon us by experience; but in the end he still
relies upon an innate and unexplained ability to discern simple relations
between ideas once we have experienced them.  In such matters <q>the mind is at
no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the truth as the eye
doth light, only by being directed towards it</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).  The lack of any account of our
knowledge of such truths stands in salient contrast to Locke's hypothesis
concerning the mechanism of sight just five pages later: <q>supposing the
sensation or idea we name whiteness be produced in us by a certain number of
globules, which, having a verticity about their own centres, strike upon the
retina of the eye, with a certain degree of rotation, as well as progressive
swiftness</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).

A notable superiority of Locke's account over Descartes', is that Locke at least
attempts to provide an independent standard of simplicity.  Foremost among
Locke's simple truths are statements of identity and non-identity such as
<q>sweet is not bitter</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])), <q>a circle is not a triangle</q>((ibid.,)) and <q>What is, is</q>((ibid.,)).
It should be noted, however, that Locke uses an older and broader
notion of identity statement than is generally accepted by
logicians today. <q>[B]y identical propositions I mean only such wherein the
same term, importing the same idea, is affirmed of itself</q>((i.e. sentences in which a term occurs as both predicate and subject, [[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).  The modern
distinction between using <q>is</q> to express identity and using it to express
predication is foreign to him. His prime examples of identical propositions
are those like <q>A centaur is a centaur</q> in which the same term explicitly occurs
as both subject and predicate but when pushed.

More complex truths
Euclidean geometry does include 

Thus he counts both <q>three are equal to one
and two</q>((original: <q>three are more than two and equal to one and two</q>, [[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])) and <q>A centaur is a centaur</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]])) as true identity statements. In

and hints at other forms
While he discusses such relations at length, and the various ways in which the
ideas of such relations are formed ,
(cause and effect, be
<q>we cannot but observe that several particular, both qualities and substances,
begin to exist; and that they receive this their existence from the due ap-
plication and operation of some other being</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]]))

some places Locke claims that all simple truths are statements of identity or
non-identity((<q>I grant further, that the foundation of all our knowledge lies in the faculty we have of perceiving the same idea to be the same, and of discerning it from those that are different; as I have shown in the foregoing chapter.</q>, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10615 )). In others, however, he explicitly says there must be simple
truths other than identity statements: <q>For, since all distinct ideas must
eternally be known not to be the same, and so be universally and constantly
denied one of another, there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all,
if we could not perceive any relation between our ideas</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]])) (and here Locke
makes it clear that he intends <q>any relation</q> other than identity).  But he
gives no account of these other simple truths apart from a handful of examples
such as <q>three are more than two</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]])).

first odd square number greater than 1 is equal to two plus one'.

that two lines are the same length or two angles of the same measure by
constructing an intermediate which is shown equal to both.)

is used to prove both Proposition 47 -  Pythagoras’ theorem - and  Proposition

example he mentions 29 times in his Essay. Thus it appears

The ability to tell that one idea is identical with itself nd distinct from all

One of the fundamental axioms of Euclid's geometry is that (Postulate 4)
_All angles between two straight lines that are equal to their adjacent angles, are equal to each other._

This cannot be taken as a raw ability to recognise right angles, for
establishing that a particualr angle is a right angle can require lengthy proof.

A raw ability to distinguish different ideas form one another.

Pythagoras's theorem, were precisely *not* statements in which

Locke acknowledges this explicitly:

our ideas and the reality of things.</q>, and goes on to give a blend of three
weak arguments

Another, related, problem is the continued dependence upon the consonance between of ideas
and the external properties they represent


    simple ideas, which since the mind, as has been shown, can by no means make
    to itself, must necessarily be the product of things operating on the mind,
    in a natural way, and producing therein those perceptions which by the
    Wisdom and Will of our Maker they are ordained and adapted to. From whence
    it follows, that simple ideas are not fictions of our fancies, but the
    natural and regular productions of things without us, really operating
    upon us; and so carry with them all the conformity which is intended; or
    which our state requires
this mixes together three distinct reasons for conformity: an appeal to God's
grace, taht since , and 
In the end however, Locke falls back upon the ancient reliance of a match

Many of the confusions and inconsistencies that plague Locke's account of our
knowledge

[[leibniz|Leibniz]] is the first modern philosopher to attempt to provide an account of
our knowledge of necessary truths more substantial than simply <q>seeing by
the light of reason</q> that they must be true. He is also the first to suggest
that the chief method of reasoning is the analysis of meanings and the unpacking
of definitions:
    demonstrating is nothing but displaying a certain equality or
    coincidence of the predicate with the subject (in the case of a reciprocal
    proposition) by resolving the terms of a proposition and substituting a
    definition or part of one for that which is defined, or in other cases at
    least displaying the inclusion so that what lies hidden in the proposition
    and was contained in it virtually is made evident and explicit through
    demonstration.
He is also the first to dream of a formal system of logic in which all chains of
deduction would be mechanically checkable. In these firsts he anticipated the
central issues, doctrines and methods of 20th century analytic philosophy,
though in each of them he retained key aspects of the scholastic tradition in
which he had been educated. Indeed his innovations were, in large part, the
product of attempts to resolve tensions between traditional Aristotelian
accounts of knowledge and logic, fundamental principles of christian
theology and our possession of knowledge justified by observation.

The first of these tensions was between God's absolute freedom to create
whatever world they chose and their omniscience. If the most perfect form of
knowledge is that derived from necessarily true first principles by deductive
chains of reasoning, then this is the form of knowledge God must have of every
aspect of the universe. On the other hand if God acted freely in
creating the world then it must have been genuinely possible for them to have
created other worlds instead. Leibniz's solution to this problem was to offer
one of the first absolutely clear distinctions between necessary and
contingent truths:
    After I considered these matters more attentively, a most profound
    distinction between necessary and contingent truths was revealed. Namely,
    every truth is either basic or derivative. Basic truths are
    those for which we cannot give a reason; identities or immediate truths,
    which affirm the same thing of itself or deny the contradictory of [[its]]
    contradictory, are of this sort. Derivative truths are, in turn, of two
    sorts, for some can be resolved into basic truths, and others, in their
    resolution, give rise to a series of steps that go to infinity. The former
    are necessary, the latter contingent.  Indeed, a necessary proposition is
    one whose contrary implies a contradiction.  Every identical proposition and
    every derivative proposition resolvable into identical propositions is of
    such a kind, as are the truths called metaphysical or geometrical
    necessities.
God alone has the capacity to see the infinite series of necessities (both
causal and non-causal) that give rise to contingent truths:
    in contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can
    never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality
    or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone
    seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but
    the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the
    subject, since he sees whatever is in the series. Indeed, this very truth
    was derived in part from his intellect, in part from his will, and it
    expresses his infinite perfection and the harmony of the entire series of
    things in its own particular way.
While it was possible for God to have created otherwise, there was yet
sufficient reason for them to have chosen to create this world because this is
the best of all possible worlds. God can therefore trace the infinite chains of
reasoning required to deduce the contingent movements of the smallest mote of
dust.

Leibniz's position may be unconvincing to those who have abandoned belief in
a perfectly omniscient God and the traditional account of knowledge, but it was
a work of genius to find a way of satisfying those constraints. God alone can
have certain deductively founded knowledge of contingent facts, wheras we finite
mortals have to rely upon God's providence in arranging things according to a
causal pattern.  With that proviso in place however, we can rely upon the
necessity of the causal connections between our observations and external
reality to justify our beliefs. As a side effect of satisfying these
constraints, Leibniz produced an account of the justification of belief in
necessary truths by the analysis of their meanings, claimed that such analysis
could justify belief in all necessary truths (other than his <q>basic truths</q>
which supposedly stood in no need of justification) and provided a beautifully
clear explication of the metaphor on which modern philosophy would be built, the
notion of conceptual containment.

Leibniz was not the first to write of terms (or concepts) containing one
another. Peter of Abelard wrote of claims containing their consequences in the
12th century, and scholars debate whether the notion of claims containing their
consequences can be traced back as far as Boethius in the 6th century. He was,
however, the first to provide a clear interpretation for the metaphor.
Unfortunately he provided two very different, though aligned interpretations;
one linguistic and the other ontological.

In the linguistic version it is the relationship between a term and its
definition that is compared to the spatial relationship of containment. When, as
Leibniz described in the first quote above, a term is replaced by its
definition, it is 'opened up' and its metaphorical contents revealed (at least
in part). The key point being that a definition is synonymous with the term it
defines and hence such replacement preserves meaning.  If the result of such
replacement is a necessary <q>basic truth</q>, then the unexpanded original is
also a necessarily true. If knowledge of <q>basic truths</q> can be justified,
or they are so fundamental that no justification for them can be given or
reasonably required, then knowledge of all necessary truths that can be reduced
to <q>basic truths</q> by selectively revealing the contents of their terms can
also be justified.  This sense of containment, and the attendant account of our
knowledge of necessary truths, is as clear as the notion of synonymy which is
supposed to hold between terms and their definitions. 

In the ontological version of the metaphor it is the relationship between an
object and its properties and relations that is compared to spatial containment.
Leibniz was deeply committed to the Aristotelian principle that each meaningful
assertion has a single subject and a single predicate and either affirms or
denies that predicate of that subject((This already involves a confusion between use and mention - between subject as word and subject as object - which is a serious though remediable fault.  Leibniz, however, is careless of the distinction and the ambiguity is not immediately relevant to our current concerns.)). This is the form of sentences such as
<q>Jan is not happy</q> or <q>All women are mortal</q> (though in the first the
subject is individual and in the second it is universal).  Among its other
limitations, it is difficult to apply Aristotle's logic to sentences such as
<q>Mary is to the right of John</q> which, at least superficially, has two
subjects and expresses a relationship between them. Driven by a the procrustean
urge to make all statements fit within the limits of Aristotelian logic, Leibniz
sought to give a compatible account of the objects that make our statements
true. On this view each object <q>contains</q> within itself all the truth
makers for all the sentences of which that object is the subject. In order to
get a sense of this form of containment consider the sentence <q>Mary is to the
left of John</q>.  This can be coerced into subject-predicate form as
<q>Mary is John-leftward</q>((Or, of course as <q>John is Mary-rightward</q>. A devotee of Aristotelian logic might dismiss the choice between these alternatives as due to a defect in ordinary language.)).  If one takes subject-predicate form seriously,
this odd sentence concerns only Mary, and it must be something about Mary that
makes it true. On roughly these grounds, Leibniz held that each object <q>always
expresses within itself its relations to all others</q> ((Letter to De Bosses, [[local:zz.texts/leibniz1716.lettersAndPapers.pdf]])).  Indeed it is within
God's power to make <q>Mary is John-leftward</q> true without John existing, though
God would not do so <q>because he has decreed that all things should function
most wisely and harmoniously</q>((Letter to De Bosses, [[local:zz.texts/leibniz1716.lettersAndPapers.pdf|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Philosophical Papers and letters]])).  In this sense, according to Leibniz,
each object <q>contains</q> all its properties and relations.

Doctrines based upon these two metaphors would go on, eventually, to play a key
role in the origins of analytic philosophy. The first would inspire the central
doctrine of analytic philosophy: that belief in necessary truths is justified
solely by analysis of their meanings. The second would give rise to
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Doctrine_of_internal_relations&oldid=1154083324#cite_ref-1|the doctrine of internal relations]], whose rejection was a key rallying point of
early analytic philosophy. Before either of those developments, however, a far
more significant limitation or the assumption that all sentences are of
subject-predicate form would have to be recognised and overcome.

Earlier natural philosophers, most notably Descartes, grossly
underestimated the difficulty of providing a complete and true theory of the
physical world. At time writing as though they

Leib
Kant's distinction between anaytic and synthetic truths is largely inspired
by Leibniz.

In large part his metaphysical doctrines were the result
of his procrustean efforts to make all patterns of reasoning fit within the
limits of a logic based upon Aristotelian syllogisms and a rule for substituting
equals for equals - most notably the substitution of _definiens_ for

_definienda_ - which he borrowed from algebra.

This is not to suggest that Leibniz's views on language, reasoning and necessity
were unknown to his contemporaries and immediate successors. Leibniz had
been one of the most prolific letter writers of the 17th century, corresponding
with over 1100 people over his lifetime and his ideas percolated into the
awareness of other philosophers. But it was easy to lump his fantastical claims
concerning langauge and reasoning together with his fantastical claims
concerning the substances composing the universe. Indeed, though the nature of
the connection between the two was unappreciated at the time, this was not

The idea that necessary truths could be discerned, and belief in the justified,
by means of the analysis of their meanings, and the expansion of definitions,

Although Leibniz was the first to suggest that necessary truths might be
discerned, and belief in them justified, by the analysis of their meanings, his
account of necessity still divereged sigfnificantly from his modern inheritors.

necessary truths can be reduced by unpacking their meanings. Replacing terms

held that all truths were analytic, not just necessary truths, but that in
contingent truths the analyses could proceed infinitely some the analysis was of

==== hume ====
[[hume|Hume's]] avowed purpose in his [[hume1739.treatiseHumanNature.pdf|_Treatise of Human Nature_]] was to <q>introduce
the experimental method of reasoning</q> into the study of what is now called
human psychology. He does not, of course, stoop to perform any experiments, but
rather his intent is to develop a theory which is supported by observations of
human behaviour and thought in the same way that mechanistic physics was thought
to be supported by observations of natural phenomena.  In particular, Hume
claimed that our beliefs in casual relations are themselves caused by
psychological processes responding to causally efficacious (and hence
empirically accessible) properties such as contiguity, succession and
repetition. Those psychological processes, according to Hume, operated merely by
custom and habit rather than reasoning, and provide no justification for
confidence in the beliefs they produced.  Hence, among other things, <q>we
cannot give a satisfactory reason, why we believe, after a thousand experiments,
that a stone will fall, or fire burn</q>; and our beliefs concerning external
objects are caused by sensations rather than inferred from them: <q>belief is
more properly an act of the sensitive, than the cognitive part of our
natures</q>.

Though Hume is justly renowned as an empiricist and sceptic of causation, in his
most reflective and melancholy moods his skepticism extends far further. Just as
the empirical scientist's confidence in causation is itself caused, but not
justified by her observations of repeated succession, so too is the
mathematician's confidence in his proofs caused but not justified:
    Every time he runs over his proofs, his confidence encreases; but still more
    by the approbation of his friends; and is rais’d to its utmost perfection by
    the universal assent and applauses of the learned world. Now ’tis evident,
    that this gradual encrease of assurance is nothing but the addition of new
    probabilities, and is deriv’d from the constant union of causes and effects,
    according to past experience and observation.
Just as no experience is caused by a necessary connection between external
events, such as the striking of a billiard ball and its subsequent movement; so
too with our thoughts, we sense only that one thought comes after another and
not that there is a necessary connection between them.
[:Hume's positive account of belief formation by means of association does not
concern us here since it is only an account of how those beliefs are formed and
*not* of why they are justified:]

Hume's _Treatise_ is thus the first influential attempt to grapple with the
tension between the traditional account of knowledge and causal accounts of
belief formation. Hume claimed, somewhat unclearly and intermittently((as innovators and discoverers are wont to do)),
that if the formation of beliefs is a purely causal process, and like other
natural causal processes insensitive to modal relations, then we can
have no justification for believing in such modal relationships. In
particular no justification for believing there are <q>necessary connexions</q>
between causes and their effects. It is not, however, only beliefs in necessary
truths that are cast into doubt.  According to the traditional view, reasoning
is a process of forming beliefs in response to their modal connections. In
reasoning one infers a belief from others because one <q>sees</q> or somehow
discerns that it _must_ be true if those others are true.  If, on the one hand,
reasoning requires sensitivity to the modal connections between beliefs and the
justification of knowledge requires deriving that knowledge from principles
known with certainty by methods known to necessarily preserve truth, and on the
other hand, our beliefs are formed by causal processes that are utterly
insensitive to modal properties and relationships, then none of our beliefs are
produced by reasoning and none of our beliefs are knowledge.  Hume, at his most
sceptical, accepts something like this argument and concludes that our
understanding, which has led us to a causal understanding of our own minds,
<q>entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence in any
proposition, either in philosophy or common life. ... We have therefore, no
choice left but betwixt a false reason and none at all</q>.

=== kant ===
That Hume woke [[Kant]] from his <q>dogmatic slumbers</q> is a tired cliche,
but it is a tired cliche for good reason. The metaphor has the notable virtues
of being short, vivid, in Kant's own words and, not least importantly, true.
Where Hume had drawn attention to the conflict between naturalistic causal
theories of mind and traditional theories of knowledge and concluded that none
of our beliefs were knowledge, Kant claimed to reconcile the two and thereby
defend our claims to knowledge by the traditional standard.

The costs of Kant's proposed reconciliation were high. Gone was all
hope that the properties of objects were as our thoughts and experiences
represented them.  Gone too all hope of reason justifying substantive knowledge
of such objects. Indeed Kant decried the pursuit of knowledge of objects <q>as
they are in themselves</q> as the fundamental error that had prevented
metaphysics from entering <q>upon the secure path of a science</q> capable of
producing knowledge.  Not only was reason incapable of revealing any truth about
<q>things as they are in themselves</q>, but nothing could be known about them
whatsoever. The match between our experiences and our concepts (and the other
technical components of the content of judgements that Kant introduced) however,
could yet be guaranteed and known with certainty.

The dismissal of knowledge of <q>things in themselves</q> was integral to Kant's
reconciliation between our understanding of ourselves as both reasoning beings
and as causal systems. Kant acknowledged that causal principles postulated in
empirical scientific theories <q>which properly pertain to sensibility, do
actually threaten to expand the bounds of sensibility until they include
everything, thus threatening even to displace the pure (practical) use of
reason.</q>((Bxxv)) (i.e. when taken to apply to <q>things in themselves</q> causal
theories leave no place for the exercise of reasoning in determining our
behaviour); But he claimed that this conflict was an illusion, created by
failing to recognise that we can only be justified in believing there to be
causal relationships between <q>things as they appear to us</q>.  The question
of whether <q>I am free in my actions or, like other beings, am led by the hand
of nature and of fate</q> (i.e. whether I am, among other things, free to be
influenced by reason, or like other natural phenomena my actions are causally
determined by brute facts) was to be rejected as one of the unavoidable, but
unanswerable questions which seeks to transcend the bounds of reason and
experience by applying concepts that are properly only applicable to <q>things
as they appear to us</q> to <q>things as they are in themselves</q>:
    no contradiction arises when we think the same will in both these ways: in
    its appearance (i.e., in its visible acts), as conforming necessarily to
    natural law and as to that extent not free; yet on the other hand, qua
    belonging to a thing in itself, as not subject to that law, and hence as
    free.[[local:zz.texts/kant1787.critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_]]((Pluhar/href="Translation))"/g
We could not, of course, know ourselves to be free, anymore than we could know
any of our concepts to apply correctly to any <q>thing in itself</q>, but we
were not precluded from entertaining the possibility. So too we could still hope
that our beliefs were, at least sometimes, the product of reasoning.

Whether or not his proposed reconciliation is satisfactory, Kant completed the
[[#a curious inversion|curious inversion]] noted above.  Where Hume had focused on the lack
of justification for our beliefs about the contingent external world, Kant
focused explicitly on the justification for our beliefs in necessary synthetic
_a priori_ truths.  Kant clearly understood that if any of our beliefs
concerning the external world were to satisfy the traditional requirements for
knowledge, there must be necessarily true first principles in which certain
belief could be justified _without experience_ and from which the rest of our
knowledge could be deduced with the aid of experience.  The method of deduction
was that of Aristotelian syllogistic which (even if it was later found to be
incomplete) could, like the modern logics that supplanted it, be precisely
described in terms of the formal((or syntactical)) properties of sentences, and
by that standard was completely clear.  Hence, in Kant's view, the problem of
explaining the justification for our beliefs about the external world
amounted to finding the justification for believing in suitable necessary
_a priori_ principles. Where the traditional Aristotelian view had held the
active intellect to be a faculty for distilling universal properties from direct
encounters with their instances, Kant held reason to be <q>the faculty that
provides us with the principles of _a priori_ knowledge</q>((Critique of Pure Reason A11)). Where Aristotelian
first principles concerned the essential properties of external objects and were
learnt from experience, Kantian first principles were known independently of
experience, concerned the fundamental properties of the world
_as it appeared to us_, and reflected the perceptual and conceptual structure of
our minds rather than the modal structure of the world.

===== causes of rejection =====
[[kant|Kant's]] philosophy had not one, but two heydays, and at its height
its dominance among European philosophers rivalled Aristotle's hold on
European philosophers in the late middle ages. Indeed it was so widely accepted
that it spread beyond the narrow confines of professional philosophy and began
to influence other European social institutions, particularly in Germany.  It is
an essentially conservative philosophy and part of its appeal to
non-philosophical authorities was that it provided a plausible defence for
continued belief in the traditional tenets of European religion and morality in
the face of scientific discoveries that appeared to leave no room for either.

There is no single reason why Kant's system eventually fell out of favour.  To
be sure, there were internal problems.  If causation were only a
relationship between <q>things as they appear to us</q>, and never between
<q>things as they are in themselves</q> then those unknowable totally non-mental
<q>things in themselves</q> could not be the causes of the experiences
representing them; and a version of Hume's concern that we had no justification
for believing that our experiences were caused by non-mental objects remained
unanswered after all.  While versions of this criticism led some influential
German philosophers (such as Fichte and Schopenhauer((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself#Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte)))
to reject Kant's notion of the <q>thing in itself</q>, it was far from a key factor.

A more tangible problem was that several of the principles Kant had claimed to
be necessary truths known with certainty and independently of any experience
were later rejected on the basis of empirical evidence.  In particular, Kant had
claimed that the structure of space and time must be Euclidean by virtue of
unalterable fundamental structures in the human mind.  By contrast, according to
Einstein's theory of general relativity space-time was curved and its geometry
utterly independent of any mind. The theory contained various predictions,
most notably concerning the bending of light around massive objects such as
stars, which were subsequently verified. Kant had also claimed that all events
we could experience must be caused deterministically by virtue of the systematic
structure that human understanding gave to our experiences. By contrast, quantum
mechanics made detailed and irreducibly probabilistic predictions about matters
such as the decay of radioactive particles and again those predictions were
repeatedly verified. Even if Kant's system could be modified to render it
compatible with these discoveries, the mere possibility of error in judging
the truth of these principles or even in judging whether or not they were
_a priori_, threw the foundations of Kant's system into doubt. While these
issues were more compelling than the technical problems within Kant's system,
they were still not a decisive factor.  The relevant empirical discoveries were
largely made after Kant's system had already fallen out of favour. To those who
had already rejected Kant's system they served only as the final nail in its
coffin, while the core of remaining believers were so committed that these
discoveries did little to change their minds.

As it turned out, however, it was a combination of two other factors which had
the most effect in displacing the systems developed by Kant and his followers:

The first was the failure of Kant and his followers to deliver on
their promise of a metaphysics that was <q>purified by critique, and estabished
once and for all</q>((ibid., Bxxv)).  One of the central claims of Kant's
_Critique of Pure Reason_ had been that it would put an end to those
<q>questions which, by the very nature of reason itself, it is not able to
ignore, but which as transcending all its powers, it is also not able to
answer</q>((Critique of Pure Reason, 1st edition, 1st page, 1st paragraph))  by demarcating the limits of human _a priori_ knowledge, making the
justification of our knowledge within those limits clear and putting aside
questions concerning matters beyond these limits as insoluble. Disputes between
metaphysicians were supposed to become as resolvable as disputes between
mathematicians and produce a growing body of established results.

It is clear why Kant _thought_ his new system's purified methodology would sweep
away all the old metaphysical disputes (either by determining the grounds for
resolving them or by judging them to be about <q>things as they are in
themselves</q> and hence irresolvable). The rejection of our capacity to have
any insight into the essential qualities of objects and properties as <q>they
are in themselves</q> is a central theme of his _Critique_. The claims to
knowledge in those irresolvable metaphysical disputes were supposed to rely upon
appeals to that capacity for their justification. Once the illusion that our
sensations and thoughts had the same properties as the objects they represented
was uncovered, and attempts to gain knowledge of <q>things as they are in
themselves</q> were put aside, metaphysics was supposed to finally <q>enter upon
the secure road of a science</q>.

It is even clearer, however, that nothing of the sort happened in practice. The
justifications offered for taking the intuitive sense of <q>seeing clearly and
distinctly</q> that a claim was necessarily true as grounds for believing it
certainly changed in the wake of Kant's Copernican revolution. What had
previously been attributed to insight into the essential nature of external
objects and properties gained through repeated experience, was now attributed to
insight into the psychological structures involved in the formation of belief
(e.g. the <q>form of all possible experience</q>) gained thorough
introspection. Kant had provided a new account of capacity to reason and
distinguish necessary truths but the new foundations of reasoning and modal
knowledge proved just as open to debate as the old.  The supposed ability to
detect necessary truths remained compelling to philosophers who felt it
directly, but incapable of resolving disputes between philosophers.  Regardless
of the technical merits or defects of Kant's system (which remain as disputed as
any metaphysical claim) it was absolutely clear that in practice, disputes over
supposedly necessary _a priori_ principles continued as vigourously and as
irresolvably as ever among those who sincerely and diligently attempted to
follow out Kant's system.

The other key factor was technical advances in mathematics and formal logic.
Doubts concerning our ability to discern necessary truths had spread to the
point that they began to affect mathematics.  As one might expect, the study of
non-Euclidean geometry was an active area of mathematical investigation well
before Einstein suggested that the geometry of physical space-time might be
non-Euclidean.  Stemming from ancient attempts to deduce
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate|Euclid's fifth postulate]] from the other four postulates (or first principles) of
Euclidean geometry, investigations began to be made into mathematical spaces in
which this postulate was replaced with various alternatives. In these
investigations, our visual imagination (which Kant had taken to provide the
ultimate grounds for geometrical truths) was no longer a reliable guide to
deductive consequence and questions of precisely which forms of inference were
allowable in mathematical proofs became increasingly pressing. Partly in
response to such concerns and partly to show that arithmetic was not reliant
upon Kantian intuitions Frege produced his _Begriffschrift_, the seminal text of
modern logic, in 1879.

There were certainly critics of Kant's metaphysics, and of the disputed
speculative theories his followers developed, before Frege's work became well
known.  In the mid-19th century these critics included popular exponents of
materialism, which denied the existence of non-physical objects, and positivism,
which held all knowledge to be about one's own sensations; but these
alternatives did not win wide acceptance among philosophers. Whatever its flaws,
Kant had attempted to draw a distinction between those claims where our reason
was on firm ground and provided knowledge (such as those of geometry) and those
where it led us astray and produced only metaphysical speculation. However much
critics might disagree with Kantian metaphysics, without a principled account
of our knowledge of necessary truths which provided grounds for rejecting the
wild speculations of Kant's followers, but was yet adequate to allow for our
knowledge of the truths of geometry((Now cast as concerning non-physical spaces.)) and mathematics, alternatives to Kantian
metaphysics appeared equally dependent on their proponents' intuitive
sense of necessity and no unified opposition developed.

<q>The new logic</q>, as its English speaking proponents tended to call it,
captured a far wider and more complex range of inferential patterns than the
traditional Aristotelian logic which Kant had declared to be <q>closed and
completed</q> just one hundred years earlier. The inadequacy of Aristotelian
logic for the inferences required in geometry had been one of the instigations
for the _Critique of Pure Reason_.  Since the truths of geometry could not be
purely logical truths, there must be extra-logical _a priori_ principles which
were true by virtue of irreducible modal relationships between the concepts they
contained((e.g. the relationship between the concept of a straight line, and that of the shortest distance between two points)), and the intricate system of the _Critique_ was constructed to explain
our knowledge of those principles.

By contrast, it was reasonable to hope that the new logic rigourously delinated
all the patterns of inference required for mathematics((including both Euclidean and non-Euclidean goemetry)).  Vindicating that hope
was the chief purpose of Russell and Whitehead's _Principia Mathematica_ which,
for a time after its publication in 1910, was regarded as one of the great
intellectual achievements of the 20th century.  Russell and Whitehead took the
sentences of their system of symbolic logic to be expressing the propositions of
mathematics in explicit notation. The apparent success of their system raised
hopes that the new logical notation could explicitly express the ultimate, but
hidden, structure of the meanings of all the sentences of ordinary langauge.
Once this <q>logical structure</q> was made fully explicit, valid inferences and
necessary truths could be distinguished by their syntax.

With a new and seemingly rigourous way of distinguishing between metaphysical
speculation and the solid reasoning exemplified in mathematics, the old Kantian
explanation of our knowledge of necessary truths could finally be abandoned
completely. In place of Kant's explanation of necessity in terms of irreducible
modal relationships between our concepts, the necessity of statements was now
attributed to the <q>logical structure</q> of their meanings. A logical
structure that could be known by the speakers of the relevant language who
presumably knew, or could figure our, the meanings of their statements.

Though Kant's philosophy has lost its dominant position among Anglo-European
philosophers it still retains some adherents((Indeed for reasons discussed ???>below<??? there has been a recent resurgence in Kant's philosophy.)).  Kant's most
significant lasting influence, however, is the major sociological landmark of
modern philosophy. The divide between continental and analytic philosophy
is between those who, on broadly Kantian grounds, continue to take introspective
awareness of their mental states as a source of knowledge about the necessary
features of the world, and those seek to place tighter, publicly discernable
limits on the claims of reason, in order to deliver on Kant's promise of a
philosophy freed from irresolvable disputes. The former remained closer to the
older humanistic understanding of ourselves, maintain the ambitions of
philosophy to answer seemingly profound  and held that science was at best a partial description of
the world.

== analytic philosophy ==
Analytic philosophy is the third and last of the movements since the 12th
century to achieve such dominance among Anglo-European philosophers as to
comprise an orthodoxy. Unlike the preceeding Aristotelian and Kantian movements
which were largely named and deliniated by their opponents in hindsight, many
analytic philosophers explicitly identified themselves as such.  While the
founding figures of analytic philosophy naturally predated the the movement's
name((just as christ was not a christian)), by the middle of the twentieth century there were a multitude of
conferences, journals and university departments specifically catering to
<q>analytic</q> philosophy.  Hence, the extent of the movement's membership
is comparatively clear, as is the fact that many of those members saw themselves
and their peers as pursuing a distinctively different form of philosophy; one
that was more narrowly circumscribed, but set on a firmer footing and freed (it
was hoped) from the irresoluble speculation that had marred its predecessors.

Another key difference is that analytic philosophy is named for a method,
<q>analysis</q> of meanings, rather than a founding figure.  The method of
<q>analysis</q> was supposed to be the only way in which necessary truths could
be discerned and certain belief in them be justified; in brief, <q>All necessary
truths are analytic</q>. The agreement this slogan generally elicited was, of
course, largely nominal. Disputes over whether the meanings to be analysed were
thoughts, facts, propositions, concepts, public sentences, or something else
altogether, perhaps a circuitous way of talking
about linguistic norms, became one of the movement's central activities
and no specific account of meanings or the means by which they might be analysed
ever commanded general acceptance.  Despite these differences however, there was
widespread agreement that <q>analysis</q> was the only fundamental way in which
belief in necessary truths could be justified((Of course derivative forms of justification, such as being told by a someone else who had conducted the requisite analysis, were of course recognised)), and was hence the foundation of
our ability to reason.

The reason for Analytic Philosophy's popularity((among English speaking philosophers)) is also comparatively
explicit. It offered hope of a naturalistic account of our knowledge of
necessary truths. At the start of the movement the demand for a
naturalistic account was perhaps chiefly motivated by more or less empiricist
scruples against non-experiential sources of knowledge; as the movement
progressed some analytic philosophers placed greater emphasis on reconciliation
with scientific accounts of the world and belief formation. Both motives
(insofar as they are distinguishable) would be satisfied by a linguistic account
of the foundations of necessary truth that analytic philosophy promised.
accounts of the justification of knowledge of necessary truths.

It is, to put it mildly, very plausible that learning a langauge is both a
causal and empirical process.  We certainly appear to learn to speak and
understand natural languages by observing our linguistic elders, attending to
their feedback on our performances, and practicing with our peers; in doing so
we have experiences which, when things go well, cause us to become competent
speakers of the language in question.  If, as most analytic philosophers
believed (like the Kantians and Aristotelians before them) learning a language
consisted in learning the meanings of public expressions (perhaps the thoughts
or concepts they express) and the meanings of necessary truths have some
distinctive discernable property, then our capacity to distinguish necessary
truths can be explained without appealing to an unnatural power of intuitive
insight into necessity. Of course, the chief problem was not to explain our
ability to merely _discern_ necessary truths but to explain our _knowledge_ of
them, but here too, it seemed plausible that an appeal to meanings offered a
solution.

Attempts to justify knowledge of necessary truths by appeal to definitions
had been made long before analytic philosophy. The title of the first section
of Euclid's _Elements_, has been translated into English as <q>Definitions</q>
since the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Billingsley#Translation_of_Euclid|first English translation of the <cite>Elements</cite>]] in 1570, and
principles under that title are given as justification for inferences in the
_Elements_ subsequent geometrical proofs. The original Greek title <q>Όριο</q>,
however, may be more literally translated as as <q>boundary</q> or <q>limit</q>
and several of the definitions offered under that title are more akin to
fundamental principles or statements of objects' essential properties than
linguistic stipulations (much like the definitions sought after in Socratic
dialogues). The sharp distinction between definitions and essences is
fundamentally foreign to ancient European philosophy since, as noted
above, it was generally held that the concepts that were the meanings of our
words were the same as the properties of the objects around us and hence there
was no distinction to be drawn between sentences that were true by definition
and sentences that were true. But it was Leibniz 


assumed that
our conceptsthough it has its precursors in the
mediaval distinction between has some precursors So too, though Hume claimed that
thewords were ideas, and, in his more sanguine moods meanings of words were
ideas, and, in his more sanguine moods matters of fact 

Kant, and before him Locke, had recognised a class of statements that were true

Again the claim that _some_ necessary truths are true by definition long
predated
f What distinguished analytic philosophy was not the appeal to meanings and
definitions as giving rise to necessary truths, but the claim that _all_
necessary truths were true purely by virtue of their meanings.

The centrality anaalytic philosophers ascribed to the role of meanings in
explaining our knowledge of necessary
truths account
led philosophers to seek a more rigourous account of meanings.
As the movement progressed

At first success in the development of formal notations

the early optimism that had marked its beginning
faded. A plausible account of meanings, how their representational content was
fixed, and how we had knowledge of them, proved far more elusive than had been
expected. As the earlier accounts of meaning were found to be unsatisfactory new
accounts were offered, each with a correspondingly altered explication of the
claim that all necessary truths were true purely by virtue of their meanings. At
the outset of the movement however, the sense of this claim, and its
justification was clear. It was supposed to be a consequence of two more
fundamental principles.  The first was that all _logical_ truths were true
purely by virtue of their meaning. The second was that all necessary truths were
either explicit or inexplicit logical truths. One way to understand the appeal
of these principles, and the notion of logical truth upon which they relied is
by considering their application to concrete examples.

==== logical truths true by meaning alone ====
The first of the principles which were taken to support the claim that
logical truths are true by virtue of meaning alone was the compositionality of
meaning.

Consider the sentence
    (1) It is raining and today is Friday.
If one grants the fundamental claim that the capacity to use and understand
public languages depends upon the meanings of the expressions in those
langauges, then it difficult to deny that the meaning of (1) is a
structural composition of the meaning of
    (2) It is raining
and:
    (3) Today is Friday.
I.e., That the meaning of (1) is the meanings of (2) and (3) combined <q>in the
conjunctive way</q>, whatever that turns out to be. This claim seems so obvious
that it was taken somewhat for granted by some analytic philosophers. Perhaps if
pressed to defend the claim they might point out that the only notations

early analytic philosophers' belief in this claim was that notations, such as
Frege's _Begriffschrift_ had this structure and

is so plausible is that it is part of a compositional semantics which explains
our ability to compose and understand novel sentences in terms of our
understanding of the familiar parts from which, and forms of compositions by
which, they are composed (and, at least for the moment, we are granting the
assumption that to understand a sentence is to be is some sort of successful
relationship with its meaning).

Another plausible principle of common-sense semantics that analytic philosophers
drew upon is that that the meaning of a sentence determines the conditions under
which that sentence is true. Sometimes, as in
Bertrand Russell's

the best known
short paper of early analytic philosophy,
this principle is simply taken for granted, at other times as in Frege's

for a sentence's meaning either is, or determines, how it
represents the world (or some part of it) as being, and if the world is as a
sentence represents it to be then that sentence is true((This is not intended to
express commitment for a correspondance theory of truth, but only to connect our ordinary
claims about the relation of representing to our claims about truth.)).
If this account of meaning is flawed, many philosophers were prepared to simply
defin <q>cognitive meaning</q> in such a way that 


Whatever the merits of this general principle, it 
In this particualr case, it is plausible
that the result of composing two meanings together <q>in the
conjunctive way</q> is the meaning of a sentence that is true if and only if
both of its conjuncts is true.  So too, it seemed plausible to suppose that the
meaning of the sentence *'Today is not Friday'* contains the meaning of '*Today
is Friday'* <q>in the negated way</q>, whatever that turns out to be, and any
meaning that contains another meaning (directly) <q>in the negated way</q> is
the meaning of a sentence that is true if and only if the meaning it contains
<q>in the negated way</q> is the meaning of a sentence that is false. But now if
these two operations are combined to produce the meaning of the sentence *'Today
is Friday and Today is not Friday'* the result is the meaning of a sentence that
is necessarily false. For, by virtue of the combinatorial structure of its
meaning, this last sentence is true if and only if both *'Today is Friday'* is
true and *'Today is not Friday'* is true, and by virtue of its meaning
containing *'Today is Friday'* <q>in the negated way</q>, *'Today is not
Friday'* is false if *'Today is Friday'* is true. By the same token, the
sentence is also *analytically false*, since contemplation of the structure of
its meaning is enough to justify the belief that it is false. Finally the only
possibility of error in this judgement is being mistaken about the structure of
the relevant meaning, in which case one is really talking or believing something
about a different meaning altogether and hence one is justified in being
absolutely confident that *'Today is Friday and today is not Friday'* is false.


Now in the case of <q>Today is Friday and Today is not Friday</q>

=two steps
== all logical truths are true by virtue of meaning
== all necessary truths are reducible, by analysis, to logical truths

It seems that this definition also gives rise to other statements that are true
by definition, even though they do not


Now in the case just considered, the appeal to meanings is doubly superfluous.
In the first place it does not provide any greater justification for believing
So too for all the logical terms, <q>and</q>,

generalisation of algebraic laws to apply to non quantitative relations

this doctrine of the linguistic basis of logical truth did not spring full grown
from the brow of Frege or Russell, it was the process of long development from
logicians such as for a term to have a particular meaning just is for the
inferences containing that term to ful fill certain formal rules.

= reveal already effective justification/structure
Now in the case just considered, the appeal to meanings is doubly superfluous.
It does not provide any greater justification for believing *'Today is Friday
and today is not Friday'* to be false than we had already. But to judge the
account negatively on this account is to mistake its motivation.

The claims for <q>analysis</q> were not so grand

<q>Analysis</q> was not supposed to provide us with new and better justification
for logical principles

It was not that ancient geometers beliefs in the conclusions of their proofs had
been unjustified until analytic philosophers had analysed their claims. But
rather that it provided an explanation of how we were sensitive to such
justifications.
Analysis revealed what it was that the unphilosophically minded but
linguistically competent layman was responding to all along (or that she was
using her terms in a different way and hence dispute as to the necessity of a
claim .

The person who had learnt no analytic philosophy does not have any less
justification for believing a truth to be necessary than a specialised academic
philosopher. Nor do they gain some justification

all this had been accepted by Kantian philosophy that was it predecessor
but even on its own terms there were problems: the reconciliation with science
was only achieved on the optimistic, but inherently unjustifiable belief that
the scientific image was partial, that the world <q>as it was in itself</q> was
beyond scientific description and in particular it could not be established that
we acted as a result of reasoning.

But under Kant the patterns of reasoning relied upon in geometry and arithmetic 
had seemed too complex??

Symbols such as concrete inscriptions, patterns of illumination, vocable blasts,
varying electrical voltages are causally efficacious physical objects of the
first order. If meanings were somehow mental or neurological counterparts of
symbols, then reasoning could be explained as a causal process of manipulating
those symbols akin to producing a proof in a formal system of logic.

Frege's apparent success in capturing the truths of arithmetic and geometry as
theorems

The appeal of this account of our knowledge of 
Analytic philosophy was inspired by early
apparent success in producing a
notation in which valid inferences required to deduce the truths of
arithmetic and geometry could be distinguished by

their complex syntactic (i.e. non-semantic and causal) properties.

Technical developments in logic raised the hope of devising a notation in which
each concept was denoted by a distinct symbolic pattern.

If the meanings of our statements were somehow akin to the formulae in such an
ideal notation then reasoning and are capacity to distinguish necessary truths
might be explained as the result of causal processes of manipulating the mental
or neurological counterparts of symbols.
(or the product of liguistic norms and practices)

and roles they played in our interactions

but still, whether they were norms of a sort that could be fulfilled or breached

by Frege.

Still the appeal of the approach is manifest is there were a structural feature
of the causal properties of these things (if they were things at all) that
either were, or were expressed by, 

At the time it was perhaps scruples against unempirical sources of
knowledge such as Kantian intuitions, divine revelation or .

then perhaps reasoning was the manipulation of those symbol-like entities

all the truths of arithemetic and geometry might be distinguished by
their syntactic (i.e. causal) properties.

If there were somethinng akin to that notation, then perhaps reasoning
might be explained

in which each concept was denoted by a distinct symbolic pattern

and when expressed in that perspicacious notation the truths of arithmetic and
geometry might be distinguished by their syntactic (i.e. causal) properties.
Although the hopes of a reconcilation with a naturalistic theory of mind 

the Kantian orthodoxy that it superceeded, it has at its core an account of our
capacity to reason and our knowledge of necessary truths.

Indeed an a analytic truth was simply a statement whose truth could be
determined by analysis without recourse to empirical observation.

and as such was a property to which we could have epistemic access and which
could influence the causal process of belief formation.

appeal of this approach are straightforward. The structure
of sentences, or the supposed structure of their meanings, are epistemically
accessible. Just as our experiences are caused by external objects and can give
us reason for believing in them, so too our mental states can causally interact
with sentences and their meanings. The learning of langauge is, afater all a
causal process



= just what these entities were was unclear
Frege, among many others, held that the objects to 
Russell at various times thoughts that meanings were mental entities such as
thoughts, or mind independent propositions that had concrete objects such as the
Eifel tower aogst their constituents.

and hence that the only way in which knowledge might be acquired without
experiene was my means of the analysis of meanings

That knowledge of necessary truths can only be justified by the analysis of their
meanings.

If either meanings are symbols, or are something akin to symbols, and just as
logical truths can be identified by their syntactic structure

Wheras kant's account had only offered us the capacity to hope that our
decisions were guided by reason, that there was no contradiction between our
appearances


==== frege ====
Frege's claims concerning linguistic meaning are not merely of historical
interest. They continue to influence and inform the philosophy of langauge to
the current day. By and large, however, his views on linguistic meaning have
been rejected and superceeded.  During his lifetime Frege's theory of arithmetic
was found to give rise to devastating contradictions, and in the end he returned
to the Kantian account of our knowledge of geometry and arithmetic that he had
spent his life rejecting. Thus nearly all of Frege's opinons 
However, though nearly all his philosophical opinions were rejected
his philosophy is at the core 
-
More than anything else, analytic philosophy was the product of a technological
breakthrough. That technology was first developed by Freg. Regardless of the
fate of the philosophical positions it was used to support Frege's achievement
will always be one of the key landmarks of human intellectual history.

Although Frege's motivation was rigour, rather than automation, the individual
steps permitted in his system of logic are so precisely defined that they can be
performed by causal systems responding to the physical properties of the symbols
they manipulate, or in other words, they can be performed by computers. It is
not, however, the rigour of Frege's system that sets it apart from earlier
logical systems but its complexity. The system of logic Frege specified in his
_Begriffschrift_ is the first system of symbol manipulation to reach the level
of complexity achieved by modern computer processors. More technically, Frege's
system is the first to be able to capture [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computably_enumerable_set|computably enumerable]] sets of formulae
as theorems. This level of complexity is one of the fundamental orienting
landmarks of the field of computational complexity. It is not a transient
boundary that can be surpassed by adding more memory or multiple processors but
reflects the fundamental principles for composing complex computational
processes from simpler ones. Although higher levels of complexity have been
contemplated as mathematical curiosities, no physical process has yet been
harnessed to perform computations at a higher level of complexity and it may be
the case that none ever will. Even [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation#Quantum_models|quantum computing]], at least in its currently
projected models, would only allow tasks to be completed more quickly and using
a handful of <q>q-bits</q> in the place of a polynomially greater amount of
non-quantum computer memory, but not lift us beyond the level of complexity
achieved by Frege's humble notation. To our current knowledge, Frege's system
marks the maximal boundary of the complexity of our theories of the world.  No
known pattern of human reasoning, in any field of enquiry (including
mathematics, and physics) transcends this boundary.

At the centre of Frege's 
one was the integration

The truly innovative component 
The bountiful complexity of Frege's system is due to the combination of his
If there is some complex inference which involving a 

A sentence of a given form could occur in several different types of syllogism
syllogisms.
e.g. Even though the following two syllogisms are of different types, the
sentence <q>All men are mortal</q> is a premise of both of them.

    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | All humans are mortal.<br>All mortals are ignorant.<br>&therefore; All humans are ignorant. | All humans are mortal.<br>Some humans are fools.<br>&therefore; Some mortals are fools |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

But each individual sentence realises only one form, and each type of syllogism
is identified (and named) for the unique triple of sentence forms that compose
it.  Instances of the syllogism type named B_a_rb*a*r_a_ _apple_ *apple*, such as the
first of the two examples above for instance, are composed of three type A, or
universal affirmative sentences (i.e. sentences of the form <q>All ... are

launched the movement. Here it was the relationship between symbols

not a concept not that somerthign is not an object (p.166) but he can show that
something is  concept (AAx)(C(x) = True or C(x) = False)
these things can be said or shown

Frege's ambition, was to show that his sytem of logic could capture all
necessary inferences in any field whatsoever. No necessary connections between
concepts. If, for example AAx(If Red(x) then Coloured(x)), then that could not
be because of some necessary connection between . all necessasry truths are due

If Frege's goal of capturing all deductive inferences/necessry connections (see
Frege book)
Wittgenstein took Frege's independence of concepts and raised it to become the
sole criteron by which the fundamental or atomic propositions were to be
identified. If all necessary truths are disguised truths of logic then the
fundamental concepts

by vitrue of the syntactic manipulations that we are disposed to perform (early
wittgenstein) that our expressions represent (are true under) the range of
states of affairs that they do.

Or meanings are structured entities that have properties and structures and
because we are sensitive to those features (just as formal systems are sensitive
to the syntactic properties of their wffs) that we are disposed to make the
inferences that we do (Russell? sets of possibel worlds

was it becasue of the structured mapping from syntactic forms/wffs/sentences to
meanings that some sentences were mapped to the vacuous meaning, the tautology
meaning. Or was it because we held some sentence forms, to be acceptable or
unacceptable (possible or impossible)

Since the collapse of analytic philosophy, 
a terrible malaise has set in. It has been so long since we had an account of
reasoning that was compatible with our other knowledge about the world, and the
prospect of us finding one seems to dim that we young philosophers have never
known anything else, and have along 
begun to think that this is normal, and perfectly acceptable. 
‘Well, I don’t know how causal entities such as brains grasp abstract entities
but we simply do and we can model that phenomenon!’  as one modern
philosopher puts it((Matze, 2023)).

not least because philosophy is the pursuit of knowledge by reason.

= complete collapse =
Just another failed philosophical distinction.

A conclusive demonstration that causal processes cannot reason would be as
welcome as an account of how it is that they do.

it is not permissible for us to give up on an account of just what the

We would have no more justification for foisitng our opinions on innocent
passers by than psychics (but probably with a much worse
inductive track record).
we need either an account of the justification of knowledge of nbecessary truths
or an an account of why reasoning leads to truth that does not rely upon
knowledge of necessary truths

%% this is why it is so central a problem
%% perhaps this is why we cannot do without some reconciliation

central not onl;y because of the history, but because the answer to the question
will shape the answers to all the other questions a philosopher may venture.


The consolidation of our theories of the world into a consistent and coherent
whole (at least in the sense that they may all be true of the same unitary
world) is a central traditional project of philosophy. The best known pithy
expression of this objective is perhaps Sellars claim that the aim of philosophy
<q>is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang
together in the broadest possible sense of the term</q>. To this end we require
an account of our capacity to reason that is compatible with our scientific
theories of the world (if need be, by deliniating and acknowledging aspects of
ourselves that are omitted from scientific theories).

%% indispensible
The need for an account of how reason justifies belief goes deeper than merely
reconciling our traditional understanding of ourselves with our latest
empiricially supported theories. Other features and capacities attributed to us
in our traditional theories (the so called <q>manifest image</q> of ourselves)
can simply be rejected altogether. We can, for instance, reconcile our account of free will with our
current scientific theories, if need be, by simply denying that we have free
will at all and supplying an alternative account of the causes of our actions.
So too for the hard problem of consciousness, we may simply deny that we have
qualia or are conscious in the way described in traditional theories, and supply
an alternative account of how there is a way the world appears to us.  Some have
even gone so far as to deny that we possess beliefs at all and have attempted to
provide an alternative account of what lies behind our sincere assertions.
Whether the offered alternatives can do justice to the phenomena the traditional
theories sought to explain is, of course, a matter of debate, but at least in
principle in these other areas the traditional account can be denied. Our
capacity to justify beliefs by reasoning, however, cannot be denied. Not only,
as noted [[#consequences of these differences|above]], are principles discerned
by reason indispensible to the scientific theories with which reconciliation is
sought, but the proponents of any of these alternatives will themselves rely on
reasoning to justify their claims. Reason, like intensionality, and unlike free
will, is an indispensible component of our understanding of ourselves.

we think and perceive the world and the natural objects which science depicts.

option 3
insist that the traditional view must be correct, since science continues to
rely upon it, and hence that objects that are sensitive to reasons and not just
causes (as those who favour this view tend to say) must be susceptible of
scientific investigation. Phenomenalism occasionally pretends to aspire** to
this goal.

== responses to superficial objections ==
=== No single <q>traditional view</q> ===

particularly those who are tempted to take option 4 above

To a first approximation, the phrase <q>traditional view</q> may be taken as
referring to Aristotle's epistemology, and if the claims made here about the
<q>traditional view of reasoning and knowledge</q> are not reasonable
interpretations of Aristotle's views on epistemology (and have been taken to be
reasonable interpretations of Aristotle's views for large swathes of
European/Arabic intellectual history) then those claims are straightforwardly
false. A positive point to be made in this connection is how well Aristotle's
talk of _epagōgē_ (usually translated as <q>induction</q>) comes out if one
focuses on geometry. That a circle is a group of points equidistant from a
common center, is neither an inductive hypothesis (such as all swans are white)
nor easily read as a definitional truth (such as composite numbers are divisible
by numbers other than themselves and one). It seems reasonable to suppose that
at least one person realised, after repeatedly viewing (more or less rough)
circles and categorising them together, that each circle marks out objects (or
parts of objects) that are (more or less roughly) equidistant from a common
centre; and from time to time the same realisation may occur independently to
other people.  Indeed, it appears to be a defect in <q>definitional</q> accounts
of concepts (according to which the concept of a circle _is_ the concept of a
set of points equidistant from a common centre) that they preclude a person
having the idea of a circle, (i.e.  realising that the circles they saw about
them were all members of a common category and, so to speak, <q>had something in
common</q>((Or in the terms of the traditional view, _instantiated the same universal_.)) ) without realising this relationship between circles and their
centres (and also rendering the repeated perception of circles, prior to
grasping this definition, irrelevant to coming to have the concept CIRCLE).

Now we are going to regard this unreformed talk of <q>the idea of a circle</q>
and concepts, and <q>having things in mind</q> and <q>grasping concepts</q> as
deeply suspicious, and beware of using this way of describing the realisation
that circles are sets of points equidistant from a common centre to smuggle in
some dubious epistemological theory. But nor should we trust any epistemological
theory that makes it impossible to express this point in some form or other. It
may be that there are no such things as concepts, or indeed properties, but
there must be some way to express the claim that someone may conceive of circles
without realising that they (roughly) mark out objects or parts of objects that
are equidistant from a common centre. Indeed achieving this will turn out to
be one of the final tests of the positive account offered in this treatise.

For the moment, however, the purpose of this addendum is to head off a certain
tedious kind of objection to the use of the phrase <q>the traditional account of
knowledger and reasoning</q>. This objection is simply that there was no single
unitary traditional view at all, but rather a range of disparate traditional
views across Western (and Arabic) intellectual history, of which no one warrants
being singled out as <q>the traditional view</q>
even Aristotle's, for there are a range of interpretations of Aristotle) . This
is, of course true, but those who make such an objection fail to take their own
account to heart. I accept Quine's claim that views, like stories and musical
themes, are things that simply cannot be counted. One can of course count people

and hence that the use of the definite article is no more objectionable that
the use of a plural.

Thus by the phrase

that views such as this were endemic throughout nearly all of western Arabic
intellectual history from Plato up until Descartes


But of the explanation of the manifest image and how our reasoning about the
ordinary objects we find about us, the widley influential views possess the
features attributed above to <q>the traditional view</q>. Or, again, to partly
clarify the the claims made concerning <q>the traditional view</q> by clearly
specifying some conditions that would make them false: if there were a widely
influential view commonly accepted among many philosophers in the Arabic/Western
tradition which offered to explain our capacity to reason, and offered an
alternative account of the justification of our knowledge of the objects around
us, but which did _not_ also hold that 

The exclusion of religious views
Non-religious, not because religion is irreivant to the traidtional view, or (as
is obvoously the case with St Aquinas) deeply intertwined with developments in
this view, but because religion rejects the manifest image .
This is not to deny the importance that thinkers such as Ibn Sina, Augustine
and Aquinas placed upon reconciling our knowledge of objects around us through
sensation and reason with theological and religious doctrine. No doubt there
were significant religious thinkers
but to exclude those religious theories according to which the immanent view of
the qworld is radically false.

=== ancient atomists ===
THis is not to deny that some such alternative views did exist among
philosophers. In particular, as noted [[#2nd problem: the content of scientific theories|above]],
the atomists 

The ancient atomists did recognise the problems alluded to above.
<q>by convention color, by convention sweet, by convention bitter, but in reality
atoms and void</q>

<q>Wretched mind, after taking from us your evidence, do you overthrow us? Our
fall will be your defeat!</q>
=== What counts as knowledge? What counts as reasoning? ===
Someone who has survived a modern day university arts course, or engaged with
almost any of the academic humanities as they are currently practised, may
naturally suspect that any enquiry into the nature of knowledege and reasoning
must begin by defining its terms, and that those definitions will largely
pre-determine what account we eventually arrive at regarding the nature of
reasoning and knowledge.  That, to put in its crudest form, "It all depends on
what you mean by 'knoweldge' and 'reasoning'".  This view however, is itself a
remnant of the ancient view outlined above, according to which the only way to
arrive at knowledge is by starting with certain principles (reflecting either
the essential properties of objects or our definitions or perhaps both) and then
derive consequences from them. The fact that such approaches are still often
regarded as the pre-eminent method of conducting an intellectual investigation
is both a sign of how the ancient view lingers on in the humanities departments
of academia, and how bankrupt those departments have (often) become.

The approach followed here is more akin to an investigation into a new and
only partly understaood observed phenomena.  Rather than starting with
definitions we shall begin with exemplars and search for any underlying
principles that might explain or unite them. 

Like the ancients Geometry, the giving of proofs concerning the relative length
of lines, closed figures consisting of such lines and the size of circles and
angles. The proof by which each of us is genuinely convinced that the area of
the square based upon the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the
sum of the reas of the squares based on its other two sides(and not merely brow
beaten into acquiesing with this claim). The argument Socrates presents to the
slave boy in the [[Meno]] oldest exemplar of this kind of
reasoning (in any tradition ((While mathematicians in both China and the Indus
valley knew of geometrical truths including Pythagoras's theorem hundreds of
years before the Greeks, in those traditions they were justified by
examples. Iboth chinese mathematicians and those of the
These must all count as reasoning, and
the claims issued must in some sense count as true.

Whatever is going in these exemplars had better count as
reasoning.

The attitude I am proposing to follow can be couched as a form of
humility. If our philosophical account of reasoning implies that any of the
cases above are not instances of reasoning, or that they do not lead us to
gain justified true beliefs about the world or that those beliefs are not
knwoledge; then it is more likely that our account of knowlege and reasoning is
wrong rather than those cases not being knowledge. Rather than collapsing into
scepticism if the account of reasoning we uncover does not fit our
preconceptions, let us take our amazing success in producing knowledge in
geometry, mathematics, science and everyday life as more certain than any
philosopher's crazy theory.


=== any justification of reasoning must be circular ===
It is tempting, at this point, to suggest that the principles of
reasoning are bedrock. That no futher justification is required. But what we are
seeking is not justification. No more than an account of the physical processes
of the eye increase confidence in our vision.


= other cuttings =

Such a view is perhaps the dominant one amongst educated laymen and
scientific researchers. It forms a pleasing story of historical progress and
development. Philosophy, on this view, is a pre-cursor of modern science, its
methods producing genuine knowledge within a limited sphere, but producing
only superstition and false insight when applied beyond those limits. Science,
through the use use of mathematical techniques for precisely describing
empirical observations, and by abandoning the pretense at _deducing_ knowledge
from those observations, has managed to transcend those bounds.
