An outline 
Semantic holism is the doctrine that the primary bearers of meaning are whole
theories and not individual sentences.

This trail leads from a description of evidence to an argument for semantic
holism and thence to some of semantic holism's consequences.

It is not unusual for novel doctrines to be dimly apprehended at first.

Quine introduced semantic Holism appeared to be both a consequence of
rejecting modality and rejecting

treated as a reductio ad absurdam of extensionalism, and thereby the principle
that our reasoning capacity could be described in scientific terms.

If we could not make sense of intensional idioms, if the very claim that our 

Like many first presentations of novel doctrines??first impressions are
erroneous, and where they are not erroneous they are often presented in confused
and confusing ways



why and in what sense is holism true

    1) what can we know of the objects on the far side of an epsitemic
       bottleneck
    2) under what conditions are we justified in beieving in objects. given that
       we have knowledge of the state of things in an epistemic bottleneck

       objects

       the barrier may also be - a keyhole may be an epiostemic bottleneck

       reason, not prepared to open the door
       computer screen
    3) object permanence. (Certainly the starting point for Berkley.)
       not enough - assumes locality - a structure of space and time beyond
    4) not that we cannot <q>explain</q> or - we cannot even describe the
       pattern of states of the objects in the bottleneck that  wihtout the
       postulation of such objects

what sort of knowledge can we have of object on the far side of an epistemic
bottleneck. Which at are the entities that are justified by the evidence (in
(e.g. individual sentences or whole theories)

This work is mainly concerned with the relationship between representations,
primarily though not exclusively linguistic representations, and the objects
they represent.

In order to make clear the relationship between our claims about objects
1) the computer case/analogy
    1) one particular case but general, in the way the Turing machines are
       general
    2) makes clear holism
    3) this is the pint at which suppossedly <q>extensionalist</q> assumptions
       will be imported. Let us acknowledge tha.
       
Evidential holism is incoherent, self-contradictory. We are not even clear what
evidential holsim is. <q>any sentence held true come what may</q>
The first point is merely to clarify evidential holism. We can then later
discuss whetehr it is adequate. To give concrete absolutely rigourous and easily
formalised examples of confirmation holism and to

that doctrines which are regarded as teriffically important ??momentous?? but
incoherent or false, and in computer science regarded as banal turhts reflecting
minor annoyances. True but of such little impoprtance that they are only
considered as minor annoyances.

Let us grant from the outset that even if evidential holism is true of computer
programs that does not imply that it is true of natural languages. Natural
languages may have additional features that preclude or circumvent evidential
holism. And nothing about the applicabiltiy.

But it does clear evidential holism of the changres of being indoherent or
unclear. In general current attitudes are not that holism is perfectly clear but
obviously false, but rather that it is so unclear that it cannot be said to be
either true or false. For instance<q>quote from ????</q>



Thus the first step is to attempt to clarify the notion of an
{[[epistemic_bottleneck]]} !!!!!
and support the claim that, at least provisionally, there are such bottlenecks
and what our assumptions are concerning our epsitemic .
And vindicate the claim that there are such bottlenecks by providing some
concrete examples.


What is the basis of our knowledge concerning objects on the far side of an
epistemic bottleneck.

What can we know about the objects on the far side of an epistemic bottleneck.
One obvious staring point being can we know that there are objects on the far
side of an epistemic bottle neck, and if so what is the evidence for that claim.
When does our knowledge of what happens _in_ an epistemic bottleneck, justify us
in believing that there is something on the _far_ side of it at all?

What must be true about the statements about objects on the far side of a
bottleneck in order that we could know them to
be true.

What can we tell about the meanings of our sentences, or rather the nature of
lingusitic representation, the way language works, the way the truth and falsity
of our sentences is determined

But we are not only interested in the nature of our knowledge concerning objects
on the far side of epistemic bottlenecks, and the relationship between the
objects that make our claims concerning those distant objects true and the
evidence for them.

what states of affairs of things on the far side can we have evidence for


What must be true of the things on this side that they can correctly represent
objects on the far side of an epsitemic bottleneck, and what is their
relationship.

What is the relationship between the objects on this side and the

What must be the relationship between our statements and the cnoditions that
they can be true nd we can know them to be true.

That it follows from these sorts of general considerations

= methodological anti-skepticism =
A guiding principle is a kind of anti-skepticism. This is not to simply
dogmatically assert that we do have know. But rather 
On the assumption that we do have knowledge

It may be that the notion of an epistemic bottleneck is hopelessly misguided,
but if there are such bottlenecks, we do have knowledge.

This assumption is not absolute, if after all we cannot find any way

On the assumption theat we do have knowledge of objects on the far side of
epistemic bottlenecks, what must the nature of that knowledge be, what is the
evidence for it, and what is the content of that 

We are particualrly concerned 
thus what is the unit of confirmation,

This can be put also as methological humility. If our epistemic theory implies
that we do not know 

this is where epistemic triangles would fit in - if they are still required


Confirmation Holism
   Confirmation holism is the doctrine that the entities con/infirmed by
   evidence are whole theories. In order to clarify this doctrine we start by
   clarifying the notion of evidence relative to one or another epistemic
   bottleneck:
    * [[epistemic_bottleneck]]
   having clarified the term <q>epistemic bottleneck</q> we then go on to make
   various 
    * [[computer_exemplification]]
    * [[why_postulate_remote_objects]]

if confirmation holism is true then
sum p > 1
we cannot distinguish analytic truths
translation is indeterminate
the unit of meaning is aloso the whole theory i.e. semantic holism



   Confirmation holism is a doctrine about the complexity of the relationship
   between . Under what circumstances must be sue a confirmation

when does the evidence justify us in believing that there are objects on the far
side of an epistemic bottleneck?


To what extent can our statements about the objects on the far side of a bottle
neck be justified, what are the entities justified by 

as a first question - when are we justified in believing that there is anythjing
on the far side


the simplest answer is never: this is the answer given by the positivists and
the logical positivists
    The fundamental doctrine of a true philosophy, according to M. Comte, and
    the character by which he defines Positive Philosophy, is the following:—We
    have no knowledge of anything but Phaenomena; and our knowledge of
    phaenomena is relative, not absolute. We know not the essence, nor the real
    mode of production, of any fact, but only its relations to other facts in
    the way of succession or of similitude. These relations are constant; that
    is, always the same in the same circumstances. The constant resemblances
    which link phaenomena together, and the constant sequences which unite them
    as antecedent and consequent, are termed their laws. The laws of phaenomena
    are all we know respecting them. Their essential nature, and their ultimate
    causes, either efficient or final, are unknown and inscrutable to us.

A religion must be something by which to "systematize" human life. His
definition of it, in the "Catéchisme," is "the state of complete unity which
distinguishes our existence, at once personal and social, when all its parts,
both moral and physical, converge habitually to a common destination.... Such a
harmony, individual and collective, being incapable of complete realization in
an existence so complicated as ours, this definition of religion characterizes
the immovable type towards which tends more and more the aggregate of human
efforts. Our happiness and our merit consist especially in approaching as near
as possible to this unity, of which the gradual increase constitutes the best
measure of real improvement, personal or social.



given that wew can tell when

whenever the bliefs are justified then the corresponding belief must be true.
thus we can get an angle of the truth-conditions of those sentences.
this is in a sense the Kantian/copernican revolution

what are the truth conditions of the statements about objects on the far side of
an epistemic bottleneck such that our belief in them could be justified.

On your (lets call it realist, thouogh of course I amintain that my position is
the only form of realism  there is) interpretation there is no jusitifcation for
believing our beliefs (concerning far objects) to be true, thus you fall into
skepticism. But skepticism is false many of our beliefs are justified, at least
by the standards around here. So what must our beliefs be 

???^^^ is this a bridge from confirmation holism to semantic holism - they
have to be claims that are actually confirmed.

if truth, correct representation that the the concepts in the claim stood in some 1-1 correspondence relationship to
the properties of the far obejct, then we would have no reason to believe them
to be true sicne there would always be other implementations that manifested the
same evidence - but we are justified in beliving those theories with greater
confidence (sum of confidence > 1)


underdetermination of theories by evidence.

confirmation conditions are fixed by language

== semantic  holism ==
It must be possible for us to learn our languages

epistemic triangle

consequences:

theoretical  under-determination

no analytic/synthetic distinction

must be more than one implementation since turing machine equivalence is
undecidable.

????-QUOTED
The problem

Do two halting Turing machines accept the same language (or compute the same "function")?

is undecidable.

Let 𝑀
 be an arbitrary Turing machine. Let 𝑀′
 be a Turing machine that on input 𝑥
, simulates 𝑀
 (on some predefined input) for |𝑥|
 steps and accepts if (and only if) 𝑀
 halts within |𝑥|
 steps (or, if you want to go with a TM computing a function, returns 1
 if 𝑀
 halts within |𝑥|
 steps and 0
 otherwise).

If 𝑀
 doesn't halt then 𝑀′
 accepts the empty language (or, computes the function 𝑓(𝑥)=0
). If 𝑀
 does halt then the language 𝑀′
 accepts is non-empty (or, the function is non-constant).

This gives a reduction from the Halting problem to the problem of detecting equality, since we just need to ask whether 𝑀′
 is equal to the machine accepting the empty language (or, the machine computing the function 𝑓(𝑥)=0
).

This avoids all the issues of the function not being total or being unable to construct the function explicitly.

need to show that the class of TM that accept a given language is undecidable

this seems good!!!!! ????

= prologue =
== why semantics? ==
The last and most influential philosophical movement held that the account of
meaning was intimately conencted with our knowledge of necessary truths. Holding
that these were true by virtue of meaning alone. For this reason alone it would
be worhtwhile to understand

////if we could deliniate the right set of represetations/statements in non modal
terms then we can deliniate the class of possible truths then we could account
for knowledge of the truths of reason. (This motivation is the basis for
analytic philosophy and needs to be mentioned in that context in the historical
trail ???? cross reference here

but the belief in a deep connection bewteen these two fields/issues/areas goes
back to the oldest accounts of reasoning in the western tradition (see
{[[plato]]})

grounding - could my chair be implemented this way or that way? we dont want to
make this a matter of definition grounding gives us a desired level of
flexibility - now we can continue to tlak of chairs while


= sequence =
We begin this path with a defence of confirmation holism. That the relationship
between evidence and the beliefs that are justified by that evidence, obtains,
fundamentally and in the first place** between evidence and whole theories,
rather than, for instance evidence and individual statements or individual
thoughts. In order to make that clear we must begin be a schematic account of
[[epistemic_bottleneck]].
By schema is this
meant some special logical abstraction? Does everything have a schema, and what
is the relationship between a scehmatric escription and a non schematic
description - it sounds lot like the distinction between the superfical and the
<q>deep</q> logical form of a statement,
???? that we rejected with wittgenstein

we choose thsoe elements of evidence that are qequired for the rest of the
argument concerning confirmational (and thence semantic) holism. The obvious
truths that are sufficnet to establish the intended argument. We make no
pretense at neutrality, or hewing to a level of specificzation that is somehow
<q>built into nature</q>????.

We are however ontologically neutral when it comes to a scientific/traditional
account of perception. The evidence may equally well be taken as stimuli or
sense-data or kantian intuitions the argument goes through .

The defect in such sparse/schematic descriptions is that they may conceal some
subtle contradiction that only comes to light once the the scheme is attmepted
to be filled out.

this is not so bad if we are tryi9ng option 1 - vindicating the scientifc world
view. ???? WHY ????

With evidence made clear we can begin to describe the complexity of the
relationship between evidence that the statements in which belief is justifed by
that evidence



With confirmation holism 


verificationism??
in some ways the earliest versions of verificationism are more restrictive that
even Descarets account.
For D claimed that

oldest best version: two statements are synonymous just in case they are
confirmed and infirmed by the same courses of experience.

the evidence for the truth of a claim exhausts the evidence available for
determining the meaning of that claim - there is a link here to deflationism
epistemic triangle


in hindsight we can see that this was the issue that motivated Descartes all
along - this concern was implicit
## recap of Descartes concerns over under-determination

Independently of the thesis about the complexity of the relationship between
evidence and theory, verificationism, has a consequence that is of
fundam,ental/extreme/significant** relevant to as just described the complexity of the connection
between evidence and the statements that are justified by that evidence there is
an important consequence of this verificationist principle.

The question is whether semantic holism

How is it that our beliefs (i.e. the
things/states/whatever that reason is capable of justifying belief in) are
about the world at all? It seems that when we are justified in believing
we are justified in beliving it to be true, and it is true 

The argument for semantic holism takes as its premise is from confirmation
holism, principles concerning translation to [[verificationism]].

From translation the key principle is:
== meaning is whatever translation preserves ==
The principle that translation *ONLY* preserves confirmation conditions is based
upon the [[epistemic_triangle_of_language_learning]] (i.e. that language
learners manage with only empirical evidence of the conditions under which
various sentences are held true/uttered/asserted by competent speakers.)

== other related cards ==
in order to reconcile semantic holism with fundamental principles guarding the
distribution of credence it appears one must accept
[[sum(P(t_given_e)_for_all_t)_must_be_over_1_for_some_e.card]]

In the other direction in order to reconcile
[[sum(P(t_given_e)_for_all_t)_must_be_over_1_for_some_e.card]] with fundamental
principles of probability it appears one must accept that the truth conditions
of sentences depend upon which sentences one holds true, and that, in
turn, implies that the units of translation must be at least *sets* of sentences
held true and not individual sentences. (Which is at least tantamount to
holism.) In that somewhat curious, wordy, caveated, way - the two doctrines may
be said to be synonymous.


complexity of interactions implies HolisticConfirmation -> slack in the system
and sum(P(theories) this slack manifests as strong underdetermination of theory
and underdetermination of translation

== Meanings ain't in the head ==
suppose that they whenever someone asserted a statement, i.e. whenever that
evidence obtained we could see the fact behind the scene. Whenever they say Gold
there is aome au23 (or whatever it is) in front of them.

But we also see that other evidence would prompt them to assert gold (i.e. they
their evidence is not sufficient to distingusih between gold and fool's gold.)

Suppose that there was, in their environemnt, at least the whole of the
environemnt in which speakers of that language were found only gold and no fools
gold.

Suppose they expand from that region into a region where they come across fools
gold on a more or less regular basis. Ifr it seems significant maybe now more
than 50% of the stuff they suppose is gold (or talk about as) is fools gold, but
maybe its just 10% of the supposed gold that is fool's gold. In any case a
significant proportion (though not necessarily evenly distributed) of the
suppsed gold make it more than 50% if you think its important ????

Now suppose that they gain access to evidence which allows them to distinguish
gold from fools gold. Maybe they build a spectroscope or some special piece of
machinery that gioves them access to experimental results that they could not
previously obtain. Maybe they get access to the neighbouring valley and can look
at the relevant mountain from the other side. 

And they decide to keep the term to describe both types of object. Here we have
something like Putnam's Jade case.

Let us vary the order of events somewhat, suppose again that we have a
culture/community/tribe which cannot distinguish between gold and fools gold and
applies the same term to both. And again they live in a region where although
fool's gold is, as they like to say, nomologically possible, none actually
occurs. Again all the stuff these people call gold is actually gold1. Now they
develop the ability to distinguish between gold1 and fools gold.

It may be that distinguishing between these two was not part of the motivation
for developing the techniques/apparatus/whatever it was that enabled them to
acquire the evidence distinguishing between gold1 and gold2. They had no idea
that gold2 existed (though it might have been something, like dark matter today,
whose existence they suspected but had not been able to verify).

Now, subsequently to developing the ability to distinguish gold1 (which they
continue to call gold) and gold2 (which they call dark gold) they expand into a
different region or somehow come across some gold2 for the first time.

argument for naturalism:
Voltaire in his _Ignorant Philosopher_ remarks that "it would be very singular
that all nature, all the planets, should obey eternal laws, and that there
should be a little animal, five feet high, who, in contempt of these laws, could
act as he pleased, solely according to his caprice,"
