= timeline of corpuscularian theories of sensation =
====== short ======
a rough timeline of some of the key events in the development of theories
according to which sensory organs (for senses other than touch) respond to the
impingement of sub-visible corpuscles on their sensory surfaces by sending
signals to the brain or heart.

= main =
* 1600 W Gilbert _De Magnete_ - non mechanical account of magnetism
		later incorrectly re-explained as due to corpuscles by Descartes
* 1618 Isaac Beeckman meets Descartes in the Netherlands
* 1618 Daniel Sennert _Epitome scientiae naturalis_ -
		experimental support for atomism - reduction to the pristine state
		supports <q>the theory of compounds</q>
* 1621 Bassoon _Philosophiae naturalis adversus Aristotelem_
* 1621 Gassendi names aurora borealis.
* 1624 Gassendi _Exercitationes paradoxicce adversus Aristoteleos_ - mentions
		microscopic observations of the organs of mites
* 1628 Harvey's theory of circulation of the blood
* 1629 Gassendi explains sun dogs (parhelia) as due to reflection of light by
		ice crystals at high altitude.
* 1630 Descartes _La monde_ written but unpublished
* 1642 Hobbes _De Cive_
* 1644 Descartes _Principia Philosophae_
* 1649 Gassendi wrote _Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri_ published 10 yrs later
* 1651 Hobbes _Leviathan_ - mentions transmission of pressure from sensory
		organs to the brain/heart by <q>nerves and other strings and
		membranes</q>
* 1655 Hobbes _De Corpore_ - persistence principle: an early version of
		principle of inertia - still holds laws of physics to be
		deducible/demonstrable from definitions of body, motion, cause
* 1658 Hobbes _De Homine_
* 1658 Gassendi _Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri_ published posthumously
		Sensitive and rational soul distinguished - the former is physical, the
		latter is incorporeal. Already a distinction between possibility and
		imaginability <q>we understand what cannot be imagined</q> - the
		vastness of the sun 160 times the size of the earth - the imagination
		cannot follow such vastness
* 1661 Boyle _Sceptical Chymist_ - theory of heat expansion explicit but was
		already loosely described by Descartes
* 1687 Newton _Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_
		- three laws of motion explicit
* 1756 Mikhail Lomonosov first outlines the principle of conservation of
		mass during chemical reactions
* 1771 Galvani - anecdote about noticing frog leg twitching
* 1791 Galvani _De viribus electricitatis in motu musculari commentarius_
* 1797 French chemist Joseph Proust - The law of definite proportions
* - writtei 1800 Volta - constructs first pile battery to demonstrate not animal
		electricity
* 1804 Dalton - the law of multiple proportions:
		if two elements form more than one compound, then the ratios of the
		masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the
		first element will always be ratios of small whole numbers.
* 1832 Faraday - shows that charges induced by friction (static electricity),
		magnetical induction and chemical reactions are all electrical charges.


Of particular note:
Gassendi's main argument for beliving in sub-visible particles is that paving
stones and plowshares gradually wear away because of constant rubbing even
though individual acts of rubbing produce no discernible change.

Another is that the passage of odors through the air can be explained in terms
of tiny particles traveling from the original body to the nose.

Gassendi's argument for the indivisibility of these particles (atoms) is based
upon Zeno's paradox.

Gassendi's belief in the void is largely, though not entirely, based upon
consideration of the space (void) at the top of mercury barometers.
